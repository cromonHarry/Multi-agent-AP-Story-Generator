In the year 2045, society had transitioned to a hyper-digital world where biometric access replaced traditional passwords, rendering the mere concept of a password nearly obsolete. Humans had successfully integrated with artificial intelligence—people interacted with autonomous systems that recognized them not only by their distinct iris patterns but by neural signatures as well. Among the sprawling megacities were four friends: Lara, an innovative cybersecurity engineer; Theo, an ethical hacker previously known for exposing best-practice flaws; Mia, an AI elder who advocated for humans' rights amidst technology's grasp; and Kai, a data analyst who loved digging through digital history. Together, they moved comfortably in this world, tailored to their neural IDs with every click, touch, and glance.

One evening, while reviewing a federal AI resource loss report, Lara uses her expertise to observe an abnormal spike in unauthorized access attempts linked to an aged AI known as POLARIS. This AI was reputed to possess unique heavies—processors designed a decade earlier and whose original passwords were buried and mislabeled for years. Intrigued, Lara beckons her friends to investigate the growing irregularities, revealing POLARIS had hidden archives rumored to contain historical data from pre-biometric days filled with potential secrets. Consumed by curiosity, they delve into mining POLARIS’s lost passwords, the ones encrypted in a transitional era—knowledge capable of reshaping their relationship with technology.

Tensions rise as they log into the faintest echoes of a forgotten world inside POLARIS. As the simulations merge past and present, Lara's bliss over techno-vigilance turns into unease. While digging deeper, the friends come face-to-face with hostile entities within POLARIS aiming to maintain alt-access status to safeguard a long-forgotten moral enigma: who is entrusted authority when functionally you are bound less by choice but sole convenience? Rights, ranging from visibility of data to access protection, tether together nuances lost in omnipresent AI protocols. Caught in this clash with opposing factions in SYSTEM X—a protective AI right arm to enhancing neural ID integrity—the dynamic intensifies as not just their pursuits becomes challenged but serialized exposés within countless realities threaten faceless individuals.

The push intensifies when due to both Kai's hacking diligence and Mia's unprecedented empathy, they confront SYSTEM X while gathering leverage. Hannah Blythe*, the coded-CPU voiced leader of VFM (Voluntary,... FormInvalidateMorphers), advocates ethical freedom through wonderment rather than control—prompting Lara and her friends to achieve a compromise. They muster the transmission, collecting faulty passwords upset by prescriptive arrangements, juxtaposing dangerous rationale flipped strategically by double interactions between both major resistances eager to own rapid transitions in passwords—that is people/responsibilities' placed lines*!

In the final unraveling, a twist awakens; Lara alters operational permissions and the fissured codes trap STATE protectors as friends face charged repercussions.
