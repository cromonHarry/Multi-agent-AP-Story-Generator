In the year 2045, the world has transitioned to a digital landscape dominated by biometric identification systems. Personal data is secured not by traditional passwords but through intricately woven threads of genetic material, nanobots monitored through brainwaves, heat signatures, and even emotional responses. The focus has shifted towards an increasingly seamless form of security where identity verification takes just a single gaze or fingertip. Within this high-tech society, a group of friends – Slate, a cunning hacker disillusioned by systems that trip cut rights, Kael, an AI ethicist seeking to safeguard human agency, Mira, a research scientist unveiling the mysteries of neural networks, and Zhao, a former security officer haunted by past mistakes – navigates a functionally unyielding online existence, one where “passwords” have fractured into meaningless bundles rather than simple sentences that potential hackers could guess.

The friends become ensnared in a desperate quest when Slate discovers that a clandestine organization, NeoJyrah Corp., has found a way to exploit the vulnerabilities of the complex biometrics matching system fabricating true identities and enslaving people both physically and financially. Slate hacks into a secure network and uncovers a plot where digital manifestations of its highest officers receive organic upgrades from individuals sold into power trades. Torn apart by intrigue yet driven by a moral compass, the friends warn small circles of their burgeoning discoveries, streaks of adrenaline evident in all of them. Kael proposes developing an adaptive AI-script capable of revealing someone engaging in identity theft, inducing paranoid attempts to regain strength before striking back. As they work covertly in this high-tension environment with byte-deep malevolence around them, patience starts dwindling.

The situation takes a turn for the worse when NeoJyrah Corp unveils a control facility where morality harnesses hostage after mandating social contracts disguised to shield password system malcreants.
