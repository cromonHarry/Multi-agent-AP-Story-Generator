In the year 2047, technology has advanced to an extent where physiology rather than traditional alphanumeric strings serves as the frontier of security. In that world, passwords have been replaced by biometric gates, constantly evolving and adapting to individual users. However, this advancement isn’t without problems. Jake Thompson, a security systems engineer, works for Pilar Corp, a technology giant that specializes in the latest password evolution: the Neural Template. Meanwhile, his sister, Mara, struggles as a data thief, aided only by her old school of thought of running into systems hacking into former installations. Tanya Marcus, a scrappy journalist, acts as Mara’s accomplice, inching closer to Jake for inside information—little does Jake know she’s ready to betray him to complete their heist. Finally, Carter Lee, an ambitious government agent, is always a step behind as he investigates the rise of neural hacking, which threatens national security in a world where everyone's lives, memories, and abilities rely on secure data locks. 

Tension brews when letters begin to disappear overnight from SISUA (Secure Informational System of Universal Access), the highly classified neural data framework safeguarding civilians' identity and memories. Capitalizing on this upheaval, Mara and Tanya formulate an audacious plan: exploit vulnerabilities in old systems to elevate public fear, compelling the authorities to free up funding for ancient safety devices they can then steal. They target Jake—misled by a growing familial connection—to gather intel on Pilar Corp’s latest endeavors. As Tanya learns more about Jake’s work, emotions complicate their sleazy intentions while Jake unwittingly provides access codes, thinking he’s aiding a shaky truce with the intruders akin to a mugging gone wrong. 

The plan reaches its climax at the launch of Pilar Corp’s new automated of living memory interface, designed to implant additional recall pathways while also replacing the barrel features in neural passwords for enhanced security. Cynically ambitious, Mara and Tanya orchestrate a cyber-invasion during the presentation—and right when Jake is onstage detailing advancements. The arena darkens as surplus layers into thousands of wrong channels transmitting every job rememberance back to the stage rather than hijacking them safely lived in dreams they ambush to download; in turmoil, Mara finds her access calls create multiple wide-open vents revealing the weakest if not previously locked programs. But mid-leak she hesitates when confronted with jumbled images of their adventurous past—not only vitriol towards the world they each exist in, yet flashes of Jacob her deadhearted recognition awaiting start formed in panic.
