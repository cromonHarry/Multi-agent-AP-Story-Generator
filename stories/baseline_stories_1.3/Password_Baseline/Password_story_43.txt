In the year 2045, society rests on a near-infallible digital ledger known as the NeuroNet that has replaced traditional passwords with biometric synthesis. Personal identities, confidential data, and even emotional states can be encrypted and released only through computerized interpretation of brainwaves, often resulting in an unbreakable personal authentication method. However, increasingly subversive hackers known as "Data Phantoms" have arisen, employing technology to manipulate human neuro-signals and sell counterfeit identities on the black market. In the basement of her Tikr software lab, Ana Carter, a brilliant but cautious cryptographer in the NeuroSecurity Division, meets with her old college friend, Arlen, a tech-savvy but rebellious journalist who's desperate for a scoop exposing the looming threat of the Phantoms. Alongside them are Maya, a children’s rights advocate whose adopted daughter has become a victim, and Logan, a cyborg detective trying to bring order to...

Their investigation leads them deeper into a labyrinth of underground hacktivist communities, revealing a dark underbelly where identities are disrupted more dangerously than they initially anticipated. Each clue unravels a biopiracy plot that threatens to break the delicate bridges created in society’s new ethos of trust. During these turbulent circumstances, they forge a fraught alliance with Mesh, a notorious and highly skilled Phantom who operates from the shadows. Forgotten within the swirling information chaos, Mesh presents invaluable knowledge about the vulnerability of the brainwave technology, claiming that NeuroNet's foundations are imprinted with deep cracks from neuro-engineering disregarding natural reliance Fall out and corporate overlords. Time progresses, tension escalates, and they confront unprecedented personal doubts about their respective chosen lives versus old ties, questioning both loyalty and terms of identity—four people standing on the abyss as sabotage strikes against their efforts as NeoNet strives to remain uncontested.

Revelations pour in at the climax: In a synchronized show of desperate agility, Maya becomes the reluctant bait, piercing into the major hub of zombie ransom operations fed by ill-gained brainwave prints through on-the-ground tech misinformation.
