In the year 2045, society has transitioned from traditional passwords to biometric Authentication Schemes (BAS) that read a complex web of personal identifiers, from unique heartbeat patterns to specific brainwave activities. This revolution was spearheaded by a powerful tech company, MuseTech, which realized the psychological barriers that passwords could create. Three best friends—Aiden, a data analyst; Lena, a coder; and Finn, an anti-tech conspiracy theorist—work in the bustling metropolis of Neon City. Each of them adapts eagerly or skeptically to this technological shift, as they witness an alarming trend: a series of dramatic data breaches leaves individuals vulnerable when their biometric perspectives were captured and exploited. Amidst their woes stands another key figure: Evie, a MuseTech programmer who is torn between her company loyalty and burgeoning doubts about data ethics.

As the characters navigate this cleft in society, tensions rise when Finn reveals that a shadowy group, known only as The Guardians of Privacy, is targeting MuseTech for their grim intentions related to biometric identities. Finn persuades Aiden, who holds minor leverage in approving systems, to dig deeper into MuseTech’s methods while Lena reveals that her estranged father, a once-renowned cryptographer whose work deconstructed passwords, may be linked to The Guardians. Alerts flash on their devices, revealing intrusive patterns that could untangle and exploit personal data linked to Neon's tangled glowing streets, hinting at coming chaos. With Evie on the tacit sidelines, the friends become recklessly intertwined, debating their next move as curiosity mingles with fear of exposure.

Fueled by the decreasing trust in MuseTech but tempted by opportunity, the friends orchestrate a heist aimed at finding conclusive answers. Just as they infiltrate Oneiric—MuseTech’s testing grounds for its newest biometric model—they encounter heavy surveillance: drones with scanning systems unlocking bodily functions and parameters akin specimen analysis. Things escalate dangerously as they commandeer Evie’s insights from her knowledge inside MuseTech, unraveling Scattered Echo, a device cumulatively launching software licenses commercially in clandestine fashion. Personal conditions pour forth gruesomely, raising algorithm brewing while gears grind painfully through each method displayed subjectively—that attaining active other minds restricted your unique path.

 Eventually, after narrowly escaping after gathering sufficient evidence—much of which still haunts their nerve-frantic minds—they are unearthed. Nevertheless, a critical disaster initiates in a heartwired ASN relaying thrills evidenced themselves amid merging deviant encryptions amongst Humanity's specters in arrivals of manic states ignited alongside instructed anomaly maneuvers to protect societal drainage by applying draconian ideas flourishing secrets yet annexed aberration illusions culminating fatal transparency between humanity, default distanced based.
