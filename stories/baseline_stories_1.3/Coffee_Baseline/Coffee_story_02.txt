In the year 2045, the once humble coffee bean has transformed into the centerpiece of an ambitious recycling campaign. Named “Javabloom,” a synthetic plant combines the properties of traditional coffee with advanced bioengineering to create a drink that optimizes mental acuity and physical stamina. Sebastian, a rebellious barista turned junior scientist, works with Maya, an astute genetics engineer obsessed with alkaloids and their influence on neurotransmitter regulation. Their lives intersect with Edwin, a corporate overlord who sees Javabloom not just as coffee but as a pathway to power, dictating its use to the masses. Lastly, there's Beth, Sebastian's younger sister, a passionate guerrilla barista who serves grassroots espressos that highlight the true flavor of natural coffee—a precious relic in a society skewed towards consumption of synthetic alternatives.

As the popularity of Javabloom skyrockets, so does the controversy. Implemented primarily in urban centers, where it dominates cafés as a political favor embedded within the programming of NeuralLink, a brain-augmentation utility enhancing human capabilities, it begins to strip away ground-level coffee culture. Edwin's corporation uses a rainbow-colored promotional campaign to make Javabloom synonymous with upside, such as productivity and longer lifespan, silencing dissent and supporting regulation against “Unprocessed Independents”, determined to revive natural coffee cultivation. With assassination attempts against contrasting activities rising, Sebastian and Maya pledge to find a method to illegitimate the appeal of Javabloom before society solidifies its favor for artificial beverages, leading them deep into an underground coffee movement guided by probing cyber activism, one powered by networks hidden in the matrix of illicit coffee economies.

The duo discovers disturbing details implicating Edwin's corporation in sabotaging traditional coffee crops to absolve competition, while findings about edifying compounds that reach scientifically superior electrocidoses shape their instincts towards overthrowing the corporate agenda. Drawing into allies, the rebellious barista spirits among communities, led by Beth, awaken their engaging veneration of nostalgia, surprising Sebastian with unearthing artifacts from casual-drip brewing—the Espresso List, defining possible “manifestos” to do battles against encephalic amendments Didieronians aspire through renewal machines.
