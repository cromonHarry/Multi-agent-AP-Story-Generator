In the year 2045, coffee has transformed into an advanced technology that defies the classic drink once enjoyed by millions. After decades of climate change, coffee production faced a devastating crisis, leading scientists worldwide to develop Synth coffee—an artificial brew engineered at a molecular level to mimic the rich flavors and psychological benefits of traditional coffee. Yvette, a young civic engineer, aspires to reinstate genuine cultivation after grieving her coffee-farming family, who succumbed to the impact of weather changes. Meanwhile, Arjun, a charismatic barista and Rebel Coffee activist, leads a movement to restore artisan coffee blends from the threatened regions. Bogotá, a quirky and historic café-CC, becomes the battleground where change brews.

Rising tensions ensue as Yvette receives an unexpected message from her estranged father, who has been hiding in the underground farming community seeking to salvage the last seed bank of vintage coffee plants. He urges her to come but warns her of a looming crackdown from the government, as they view coffee restoration movements as potential threats against national coffee economy recovery schemes. Caught between her passion for real coffee and her duty to the synth innovation community she’s just joined, Yvette finds herself torn. At a city brewing contest, she discovers the contest champion, Arjun, is headlining both rebelling against Synth culture while weaving hidden elements of enhanced genuine coffee flavors from illegal imported beans. Their rivalry sparks undeniable chemistry.

As Yvette heats up conversation with Arjun, an oblivious pilot holds a facility steeped in questionable bioenergy practices for coffee growth—Judge Meron, who insists he leads coffeemaking innovations with terveza thermodynamics. The government initiates panic as threats of rising anti-synth campaigns surface—community residents blockading roads toward coffee labs result in incoming drones scanning neighborhoods for troublemakers. Thanks to exchanges between Yvette and Arjun, they strategize to form a temporary team, spicing conventional demolition while championing an experiment to alleviate escalating conditions prevailing over organic varieties. Unbeknownst to the local populace, during their advocacy and investigation, bodysnatcher dendrites ensure they aren’t under capstones themselves as judge elections emerge.
