In the year 2045, Earth has transformed into a world where climate change has significantly altered agricultural practices. Natural coffee cultivation has dwindled, forcing humanity to rely heavily on lab-grown varieties. Among a group of dedicated coffee enthusiasts, four central characters emerge: Clara, a spirited barista who owns a small café known for its synthetic brews; Miles, a food scientist specializing in advanced coffee replication; Javier, a climate activist with deep cracks in his resolve; and Lila, a savvy entrepreneur looking to revolutionize the coffee market. Duel lifestyles and values surround them, but they each share a deep-rooted love for coffee that supersedes mere consumption.

Rumors circulate that the newly established biotech corporation, JavaCorp, is creating an ultra-sustainable coffee that could supplant smaller businesses—and ruin the burgeoning lab- and artisanal-formulated coffee scene. Miles, who faces a moral quandary due to his prior involvement with JavaCorp, becomes embroiled in the tangled web of corporate espionage, pressured by the promise of success against ethics concerns. Breakdowns in friendship appear when Javier proposes dangerous measures in protest against large conglomerates. Community outcries push Clara into a dogged crusade to save both her café and the artisanal community from JavaCorp's grasp.

Assured by Clara to sit at a defiant roundtable discussion with local growers, the group plots a collective push against JavaCorp. But just as sentiments build toward a united front, Lila discovers an encrypted data file revealing plans that unveil how JavaCorp’s coffee might distract general population attention through bioengineering mind-altering features into their lab-brews. Tension reaches a boiling point as Clara sneaks leading confessions about her café into a livestream event previously scheduled as a promotional partnership with JavaCorp.
