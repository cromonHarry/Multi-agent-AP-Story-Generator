In the not-so-distant future, coffee has transformed both in its chemistry and its cultural significance. In a world beset by climate change, dwindling resources, and advancements in biogenetics, farmers struggle to cultivate traditional crops. Enter NovaBlend, a biotech company whose revolutionary "synthetic coffee" is engineered to mimic the taste and energizing effects of natural coffee using proteins sourced from nutrient-rich algae. To its founder, Dr. Evelyn Wah, this creation represents a sustainable solution to a fast-diminishing agricultural era, but it has also sparked controversy among purists who believe authentic coffee is being erased from existence. Among the factions, four individuals navigate this convoluted horizon: Chaz, a café owner besieged by dwindling profits; Mira, an activist passionate about preserving Indigenous coffee growing methods; Jax, a skeptical ex-food scientist turned journalist; and Dr. Wah herself, ambitious yet beleaguered.

As society embraces synthetic coffee with rising consumption, Chaz's once-bustling café now echoes with the frustration of loyal customers grappling with the ambiguity of emerging alternatives. For him, the tranquil crackle of silence is more troubling than the ticking animation in terms of balance sheets. Pulling at the threads of nostalgia, Chaz attempts to breathe life back into his café by organizing a contest celebrating local coffee heritage, inviting Mira to help share the background of their traditional brews. Unbeknownst to them, the contest catches the attention of Jax, who sees an opportunity to investigate NovaBlend's assertions, leading him to cross paths with Evelyn at a packed industry gala. Compassionate yet analytical, Jax questions the benefits of synthetic coffee, igniting a primal debate on ethics, culture, and simplification of human tastes.

As the atmosphere becomes increasingly heated, the contest approaches its grand finale where traditional brewing techniques are painstakingly pitted against synthetic café masterpieces crafted by ambitious contenders, including Amanda—the upstart chef who embraces synthetic coffee fully in coveted pastry creations. Conflicts surge as Mira voices concerns about cultural appropriation while enhancing the narratives of established coffee creators like Chaz’s grandfather but pales against NovaBlend’s mechanics, reducing customs to market value. Compounding the drama, Jax’s developing attraction to Evelyn complicates his investigative intentions; their wrestle with ethical stances teeters on rivalry at the gala as Evelyn insists her synthetic creation equals progress. Just as competition spirals, an ominous announcement from politicians dewks around regenerative bio-farming provides a destabilizing electrifying closure.

Caught under this rising tension at the contest, nostalgic ugliness erupts as glimmering spectacles of present collide with what is perceived as black-and-white realism.
