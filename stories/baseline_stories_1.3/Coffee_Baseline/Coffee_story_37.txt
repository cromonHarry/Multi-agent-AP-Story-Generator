In the sprawling megacity of Neo-Earth, coffee has undergone a radical transformation due to rapid advancements in biogenetics and sustainability. The beloved beverage is no longer the result of plant-based cultivation but instead manufactured in labs, optimizing flavor profiles and reducing environmental impact. Four friends, Absynth Wilcox, an up-and-coming bioengineer; Lyra irinStephens, an activist advocating for traditional farming; Theo Zhang, a corporate mogul pushing for lab-grown coffee commercialism; and Maya Ramos, a barista and aficionado renowned for her unique brewing methods, find themselves at the center of a brewing storm over what coffee means in this new world.

Absynth attempts to explain the science driving coffee evolution in hopes of appreciation and acceptance, yet ethical implications constantly strain friendships, as varying motivations split them into conflicting camps over attempts to unify an industry in flux.

Excitement juggles with fear as public demonstrations are scheduled throughout Neo-Earth, underscoring the polarized responses and stirring curiosity. Determined to unveil how connected memories and pure culture can shape identity, Lyra decides to confront Theo and publicize an exhibit of contraband organic beans at virtually zero cost living nourishment. Thus, an interactive coffee festival culminates at Maya’s café—a symbolic stage for hashing out ideologies that distill between complexes of taste and relationship etiquette surrounding coffee as an essential life beverage of connection.
