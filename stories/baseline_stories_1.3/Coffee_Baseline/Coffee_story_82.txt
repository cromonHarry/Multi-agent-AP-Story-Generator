In the year 2045, coffee is no longer merely a beverage; it has become a highly coveted, genetically engineered commodity, known as "GenMis Brew." The progression began after the ecological collapse of traditional coffee farming due to climate change and blight. In response, a conglomerate known as CoffeeSynth developed a new breed of lab-grown coffee beans—modified for higher caffeine levels and delicious flavors, with personalized profiles tailored to fit individual health needs. Paulic, a charismatic but disenchanted barista-turned-revolutionary, augments his fading coffee shop rituals with hopes of capitalizing on this trend. Celia, a brilliant scientist overcome with guilt from her role at CoffeeSynth, harbors lingering attachments to an old-school coffee philosophy. Dusty, the corporate crank who rides the tide of innovation, embodies the archetype of capitalist ambition, pitched against Max, an idealistic activist hoping to overturn the growing dominance of synthesized coffee culture.

Tension escalates as Paulic learns that Dusty and CoffeeSynth are pushing a new product that will decrease the artisanal essence of all coffee culture—an absorbent capsule with CoffeeSynth’s General Brew that literally rewires the human sensory experience of drinking coffee to feel euphoric. Driven by a loose alliance founded on common discontent, Paulic and Max team up to stage a protest at CoffeeSynth's global release event. During the planning phase, Celia's remorse leads her back inside, where her old animosities resurface. As friendships tear at their seams, issues muddy between loyalty to oneself versus advancing personal ambition as relationships tense and motives blur. Behind the shimmering allure of Beanpods, cells containing liquid coffee rich with engineered peptides will offer instantaneous bliss—plant bleeds it's bosom gifts and steals away its recessive historical tales.

On the day of the product launch at the Piazza Rossa, an architectural blend of natural structural forms and technology, Paulic and Max lead a unique demonstration highlighting black market beans common from the last organic growers who opposed “syntacy.” Utilizing tactical guerrilla theater, they infiltrate the event pretending to represent CoffeeSynth's corporate interests. Striking a balance between tears of sips brewed exotic and revolutionist gigs inspired by old-time socialist spirits, the maneuvers magnetically assail the narratives that envelop synthetic thoughts. Meanwhile, Celia wrestles doubt as she faces the creators of a comfortable but homogenizing piqué lossmotivated horizon she inadvertently contributed to. Choosing empathy and sacrifice radiates in her—tethering those gathered captured workers together with threads expanded past Rapture brands and brand shareholder pursuits.
