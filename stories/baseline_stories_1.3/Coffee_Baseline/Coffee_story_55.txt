In the year 2075, coffee had transformed from a beloved beverage to a life-sustaining concoction known as Cafine, designed in biotechnological labs to provide humans with twenty-four-hour energy and heightened cognitive function. In this world, urban landscapes are visually dominated by towering structures accommodating farming megacorporations that produce vast amounts of genetically modified coffee plants, while Cpresso Spaces, sleek hubs, fill the corners of concrete jungles, where users ingest Cafine through interactive bioports. Harmony Towers employee Virgil Patel, influenced by his engineering background, spends his work-hours overseeing the infrastructure of these machines, grappling with unsettling side effects that users know little about. Soma Reynolds, a skeptical herbalist, highlighted potential health risks during her small-scale protests despite live feeds endorsing luxury Cafine pods with affluent influencers, warning people of “addiction disguised as evolution.” Emory Takeda, clad in ombre locks hinting at her own journey into extreme hybrid, desires peace without confidence in profit-driven approaches, adopting a third persona SerEtois – an advocate who leads rigorous petitions to revert to organic farming harmless to Earth’s biosphere.

As tension ebbs and flows underground, Soma befriends Virgil after a short circuit event brings down multiple Cafine connections, causing the whole system to crumble in downtown Alta Nova. Her belief resurfaces later with a physical encounter when people in unadulterated coffee stalls glimmer rebellion’s consequences. Meanwhile, confidence vacillates within Emory’s circles post-research suggesting added neurotoxins along with heightened perceptions, drawing public fury; citizens increasingly revive mom-and-pop bean-roasting eateries hidden in basements of crowded zones. Misfits unite, pushing against harvest unfairness in the interests of exclusives harvesting C-bots when SerEtois strategizes zine wrappers advocating artisan methods over corporate quick fixes. Seeing diminishing mental shifts and empty lethargy dramatically arising ties Virgil deeper to Soma’s connections on inhospitable farmland frays at the extension becoming iconic disconnected souls navigating underground whispers sparking hope foster echoed amid rebellion, summer days filled romances palmetto blue-pinks drifting soft tidal movements parallels flux in physiological regulations.
