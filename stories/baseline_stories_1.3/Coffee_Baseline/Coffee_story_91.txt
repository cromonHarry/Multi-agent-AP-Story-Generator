In the year 2042, coffee has undergone a radical transformation, becoming a commodity interwoven with advanced technology and genetic engineering. Coffee is now produced in bioreactors, where genetically modified microbiomes simulate intricate coffee ecosystems, controlling flavor, caffeine density, and even emotional resonance. Socially, coffee culture has been rejuvenated, fostering intricately designed cafés in arcologies towering over crowded megacities, where wary citizens sip their bespoke brews while wearing empathetic implants, which heighten emotional connection with each sip. At the heart of this world are four protagonists: Mira, a barista with a prodigious sense of taste; Caldwell, a cynical researcher who once sought to liberate coffee from corporate greed; Juno, a communications specialist navigating corporate espionage; and Von, a rebel gardener cultivating rare coffee beans hidden in the wild.

Mira has recently discovered that one of her regular patrons, the mysterious Caldwell, has a passion for unearthing ancient coffee-making methods opposed to the sterile creations of the bioreactors. Their relationship develops amid brews of nostalgic roasting and exotic spices, all while Caldwell whispers tales of land races that have miraculous medicinal properties. As they bond over the flavors of old, Mira’s interest turns to an insatiable curiosity about what’s truly happening in the industrial shadows of the coffee world. Meanwhile, Juno stumbles upon intelligence linking common flavored drinks disguised as ‘wellness boosts’ to illegal biomedical testing conducted by her employers. Technological giants are systematically testing human responses to each concoction, misleading customers into poison with the siren songs of brand reputation and taste fatigue.

Devastating revelations ignite turmoil between dawn and dusk in the city. Maya rallies her fellow baristas against the deceptive practices, organized through various cafés aligned as Café Revolution/Walls of Flavor across the megacity. Recalling old protests against syrup blockers and sugar dockets, they rebrand the mission in rioting atmosphere, and the movement breaks through mainstream news drawing hundreds into the cafés whispering the names of heirloom two-hundred resplendent origins long stripped of glamor.
