In the year 2035, the world is irreversibly transformed by environmental changes, pushing humanity to reinvent many aspects of life. Gone are the traditional coffee cultivation fields as most coffee plants can no longer survive in the devastated climates of what used to be fertile lands. Icarus, a biotechnology prodigy, has clandestinely developed a synthetic multifunctional coffee solution that offers not only the comforting flavors and stimulating effects of traditional coffee but also layers of nutritional enhancements designed to boost humans’ adaptability to the new world. For imbibers, it’s not just a drink; it’s a lifeline in a world ravaged by guilt and longing for the comforts of the past. Meanwhile, under the shadow of an oppressive biotech corporation, Stella, an ambitious journalist, suspects there’s more than meets the eye regarding Icarus’s breakthrough.

Unbeknownst to Icarus, student activist Rowan has embraced the idea of rebellion, preaching the import and celebration of traditional coffee culture, reminiscing about the aroma-strewn cafes of yesteryear. After discovering how Icarus’s joyous creation tamps down the effects of latent petrochemical within her community, she teams up with Max, a pint-sized coffee smuggler who sources ancient coffee beans as relics of a lost world. They begin organizing protests to advocate for an uninhibited redistribution of real coffee while stirring controversy with spiraled pictorials on bogus inspiration to counter Icarus’s synthetic success. Sparks ignite amid the curious public, threading traditionalists against a narrative of technological cleanliness.

As injustices intertwine into volatile demonstrations, Stella encounters a fateful confrontation with Icarus during an event that illuminates the rhetoric of reckoning and true societal progress. In this emotional standoff, Stella presents evidence of the harmful implications of shutting down real coffee cultivation by monopolizing agriculture solely to biotech algorithms. Each character is led red against fate as Rowan upholds cultural history, Max hoards relics like crocodile births scattered amidst vicious media waves, and Icarus sways heavily against existential pangs provoking introspection. Ultimately during this turbulence, Icarus craves escapism through the drunken legacy of coffee.

As social media swirls in responses, luring all factions into unpredictable romps, Rowan, uniquely gifted with an air of spirited resistance, persuades Icarus to visit dead grounds that house oblivion flavors no longer sacred to survival but essential expressions of humanity’s glories forgotten—not as merely resistance’s relic nor biotech pride but as linguistic rapture dashes filled with warmth.
