During her rigorous training, Mia and Ava bond as the latter renounces Ren’s tactics, pleading disillusionment with riches overshadowing athletes’ integrity. They hatch a counterstrategy to take Ren's financial dominance down, gambling on a newer match concept that emphasizes raw skills over cerebral distortions. Dark shadows push back on their ambitions when Tomas discovers Ren has kidnapped and perverted soccer pros underneath corporate oversight.
