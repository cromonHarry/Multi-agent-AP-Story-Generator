In 2045, the world of soccer has transformed into Neo-Soccer, a multiplayer hybrid where human athletes and artificial intelligences share the pitch in a dazzling spectacle of technology and athleticism. The game is played in massive, domed arenas that allow for holographic audiences and augmented reality overlays, enhancing the actions on field. Samuel, a talented human midfielder, can manipulate the physics of the ball using a neural link embedded in his head. His rival, Kaia, a synthetic striker created by Objective Innovations, faces off against him, increasingly gaining popularity and skills as fan engagement spirals into a digital frenzy.
