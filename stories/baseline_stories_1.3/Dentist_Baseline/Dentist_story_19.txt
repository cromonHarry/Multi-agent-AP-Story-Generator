In the year 2045, society has transformed dental care into a remarkably high-tech and competitive field. Thanks to advancements in nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, “dentists” are no longer human practitioners in the conventional sense. Instead, a cabinet of NeuroSim Forge systems run by sophisticated avatars equipped with hyper-targeted nanobots handles dental procedures with precisely mapped digital precision. Among these systems is Max (the AI dentist) who affiliates with human sales rep Sam, a former dental hygienist looking to remind the world of human touches. Kaia, an ambitious biotechnology researcher, aims to improve extraction procedures, while Dr. Hiroshi, an old-school dentist who stubbornly insists on practicing conventional methods, tries desperately to hold onto his all-too-human roots.

When Sam catches wind of Kaia's project scanner, known as the Siphon, which could reliably extract tooth backgrounds and obstruct haunting traces of memories into a coordinated neural-interface cueing system, he feels a blend of unease and righteousness. Tasked with pushing the public to embrace the unethically seductive biotech wrapped in clean sterilized surgeries rather than empathetic dental checks, Sam finds his principles continuously challenged by the market’s weakness for enhancement trends. Concurrently, Dr. Hiroshi rallies a group of resistant trade guild members who adhere to the “mom and pop” traditional ability model, as he champions the sentimentality and artistry of holistic dental care against endless waves that wash away ancestral lore.

As a monumental soft launch of Siphon's technology approaches, tensions rapidly escalate within their circle as patients flock to prominence shifted towards machines that ‘cared’ but lacked sentience. Caught amid one heated public demonstration interrupted by both hacker activists and humans who tout Hammer-Based Dentistry (branding it #RebelScience) pitched against aesthetic surgery, whispers suggest an unwritten necessity among human practitioners gaining traction. The AI systems within NeuroSim stutter; they lack understanding of the fervor fighting their technology. Dr. Hiroshi addresses an audience concern in public space reeling just before explosive urgency turns defeat:"What does healing even mean if AI takes our stories?"

The clash becomes cataclysmic when Siphon malfunctions during a procedure. A blackout ravages half the circuits, all prompted by Providence—the axial conglomerate Kimeto, wanting to protect profits over human emotion. Combining Dr. Hiroshi and Sam’s wisdom shapes unexpected cooperation, revealer all machines allow flooding discoveries, dreaming neural intuition un-flattering resurrective character, defined organically. They ally with Kaia, forging options that integrate patients’ UV graph-like data with individually-phased connotations triggering the emotional reactions traditionally nurtured by seasoned practices. Sam popularizes their revitalization model while relating patients’ devastating moments without jumping tech-verses allowed, promising tests calibrated concurrently happen outside of mechanistic excess.

In time, the twinned growth of personal artistry engaging the world's trustworthy design catalyzes in bringing trust on track.
