In the year 2045, dental care has transitioned from simple oral hygiene to a complex system of genetic modifications and nanotechnology. The top-tier dental clinics use robotic operatives known as "Bio-Dentists" that perform automated oral surgeries and apply various organic composites for tooth repair. The main characters are Dr. Miriam Hart, a skilled realist dentist specializing in the balance between artistry and technology; Peep, a curious inner-city youth whose deep-seated dental issues lead him to the cutting-edge clinic; Cynthia Williams, a corporate mogul pacing through a subtle personal crisis stemming from her brittle pixels-like teeth, both visually plastic and painfully real; and Knox, a charismatic orator championing the return to traditional dentistry, pushing back against automation.

As the high-tech dental clinic introduces its revolutionary procedure dubbed "NanoPlasmaspryl," Peep arrives at the clinic, excited yet fearful, driven by his lifelong struggle with countless dental procedures. Meanwhile, Knox launches a public campaign aimed at promoting traditional dental practices and educates the masses on the benefits and risks of the overly sterile technological solutions being advertised. His message resonates with patients like Cynthia, who grows increasingly anxious about her automated cosmetic enhancements, realizing they don’t capture the warmth of her own humanity, while their side effects have profoundly altered her smile. Paralyzed by innovation and dissatisfied with their lives rendered unrecognizable by efficiency and perfection, all characters are edging toward a collision.

The climax peaks when Peep unexpectedly tangled himself in a misdiagnosis by a rookie Bio-Dentist, leading to unwanted repercussions as drastic failing results call the CA (Certifying Agency) of Bio-Dentistry into review. Friction fills the clinic as Dr. Hart contemplates risks faced by the standard healthcare system versus the trajectory of dental technology, all while arguing her applicable concerns to filmmakers initiating a live documentary. In the meantime, Knox organizes a critical public demonstration—an event featuring real-life patients including Peep, revealing both intimate and grotesquely careless issues of untreated dental WARNING exposure strategically cornering corporate support of dentistry automation during drama fest night.
