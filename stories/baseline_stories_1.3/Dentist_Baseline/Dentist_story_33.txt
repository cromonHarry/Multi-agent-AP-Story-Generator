In the year 2045, dentistry has transformed into a high-tech blend of robotics, AI, and bioengineering. Heria Xun, a brilliant dental surgeon and innovator, operates a hi-tech dental clinic in the heart of Neo-San Francisco. Her clinic, equipped with AI-Pod dental units that rapidly diagnose and regenerate oral tissues, attracts various clientele, ranging from postmodern cosplayers to contemplative introverts seeking “ideal features.” Her close friend and sarcastic tech-developer, Lark Providesworth, holds romantic notions about the perfect world they inhabit—a paradox with lurking dangers. Recently returned to the city, Marco Santorini, an old acquaintance and homeless activist challenging the drastic depersonalization of the future, begins drawing parallels between corporate influence and sacrifice in healthcare alternatives. Meanwhile, tensions rise in Neo-San Francisco as radical fringe groups emerge, motivated by harsh anti-technological rhetoric.

A looming download unveiling of Heria's new innovation, a nano-injection lineup named "LifeSmile," which promises to prevent tooth decay indefinitely, both excites and terrifies the citizens crowding the city’s central square. However, a sociopolitical nightmare brews as Marco, increasingly vocal, disrupts the city's conscious investing in risky medical advancements. He argues that the risks being brushed aside could lead to a future where toothless remnants remain shackled to corporate dreams. Tensions mount, accumulating as marketing initiatives dominate public ceilings, and Heria, feeling the pressure from investors, grapples with supporting the functionality of her breakthrough versus the ethical subliminality of its reception, reigniting problems she thought she'd addressed years ago in medical school.

At the clinic's latest launch event, journalist and activist Rowe Wilson spies the crack in Heria’s illusion, wondering if she is compromising her integrity for commercial gain. Marco seizes the moment to challenge her directly with accusations, labeling her efforts nepotistic rather than healing. An acclamation of dissent mingles with zeal in the throng of supporters who perceive belonging via accessible reconstructive options who don’t care what infused ire breathes down their necks—An acquired talent for lip service over adverse receptions tangled the history of trials past.
