In the year 2045, the profession of dentistry had undergone a radical transformation. Dental care and prevention systems had become fully integrated with advanced biotech, making a trip to the dentist as routine as a visit to the grocery store. The central character, Doc Rhea Jenson, pioneered the use of neuro-responsive dental bots, tiny nanobots programmed to detect and mend oral health issues before patients noticed any symptoms. Rhea ran a lab in Zenith City, a gleaming metropolis where flying cars crisscrossed the skies and skylines sparkled with opulent, floating gardens. She was joined by two of her closest allies: Mo, a quirky genius who specialized in AI programming, and Layla, an enthusiastic dentist who with Rhea obsessively tweaked their systems. Unbeknownst to Doc Jenson, a sinister force was lurking beneath Zenith's pristine exterior — an underground black market for illegal bio-enhancements, where rogue dentists promoted risky procedures in the dim corners of the underbelly, recently led by the nefarious Viktor Cole.

The murder of Raine, a young and promising dental assistant who was investigating these illicit underground practices, shook the community to its core. As whispers of foul play fanned the flames of fear within Zenith City, Rhea recognized that someone was weaponizing dentistry, ultimately reshaping not only faces but also memories, for sadistic purposes. Driven by her sense of justice, and her unresolved guilt over Raine's investigation going unsolved, saving people started taking on a new ethical weight for Rhea; it wasn’t merely about mending teeth anymore. Rhea, Mo, and Layla plunged into the anaesthetic-crypted black market, donning disguises to infiltrate illegal operations while searching for transhuman ingredients that were giving the rogue procedures excruciating precision as well as wild effects. 

The tension reached its pinnacle at The Ambrosia Lounge, a high-tech hub and cyber-style tavern popular in the underground scene. Their plan worked well until they found themselves cornered by Viktor's gang while implanting surveillance technology into service bots hidden throughout the complex. Mo's ingenious programming allowed them to listen to grim plans of adding dark biotech enhancements that manipulated emotions and memories related directly to self-esteem through painful dental alteration. With limited options, Rhea employed a combination of neuro-responsive strategies, splicing crucial uprades in real-time, convincing the auditory police system to destabilize Viktor's controls. A mechanical firefight broke out, intertwining toxins and screams, forcing Rhea to mentally prioritize targets while attentively sketching an exit plan.

Barely escaping the melee with Layla and Mo, Rhea discovered a greater implication — not only was Viktor extracting grey-market enhancements but also fashioning an army of mannequin-like followers who functioned without critical self-perception due to the dental distortions programmed within them. As circulatory cleanup teams rid the aftermath, Rhea and her team started compiling all evidence forward to SparkSpectrum Monitoring Institute, the autonomous-sponsored body against underdog relish biologics in Zenith. The outreach triggered thorough social scrutiny toward the merger of empowerment with preserve ethics rapido ranging their recommendations led by an uptake in smiles. 

In a reflective closing, Doc Rhea Jenson, invigorated by overcoming troubling interactions, transitioned Nexus Care — their operatives within a graph-worthy grove — to mainstream society lucidity mode absorption: ethical bio-dentistry available and equitable viewing developed to regulate revolutionary technologies.
