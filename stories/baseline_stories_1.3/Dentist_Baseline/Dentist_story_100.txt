In the year 2045, the definition of a dentist has undergone a radical transformation. In the sprawling city of Neo-Toronto, advanced nanotechnology and AI-human collaboration have redefined dental care. No longer limited to chair-side drilling and agonizing feelings of anxiety, professionals called "Oralthermalists" use a combination of emotional AI, regenerative biotechnology, and virtual reality stimuli to perform profound operations. Dr. Leon Foster, the leading Oralthermalist and renowned creator of predictive dental models, finds himself managing a clinic that operates almost entirely on preventative pleasure—ensuring patients maintain healthy smiles before complications arise. With an entourage that includes Suri, a sass-talking AI with a penchant for humor, Mira, a health monitoring technician, and armed security AI called JAX-1, they navigate both their personal ambitions and tightening regulations surrounding edentulous care.

Driven to elevate oral health beyond traditional notions, Leon and his team prepare to embark on a groundbreaking experiment: the "Forever Smile" program. This innovative initiative promises to re-engineer patients’ genetics to ensure perfect oral health, pairing their identities with idealized avatars in virtual reality simulations designed to reduce dental anxiety. As the launch date nears, however, strange occurrences begin plaguing the clinic—patients reporting vivid nightmares associated with the process, and some mysteriously experiencing disfigurement as the program footprint interferes with reality-bending resonance transmissions. Beneath the glowing excitement lies growing tension as Mira reveals that initial data risks skewing unethically under pressure—an unsettling precursor to disastrous implications.

During a cramped team meeting held after hours, an emergency knocks at their door when Ava Hart, a patient who underwent last-stage trials, appears with untreated psychological damage, fracturing the team's perfect picture. She grasps the unyielding notion that societal expectation had entered her bodily machinery, consuming her identity, as she vanishes. The metrics they tracked simulated her concept of ‘perfect’-ness, distorting the thin line between technological promise and despair. With the clinic infiltrated by anonymous threats alleging corruption in derivatives of the outcome monitoring adaptations, Leon realizes that regardless of the shiny exterior of gratification around the Forever Smile, the implementation holds ethical bombs possibly devastating individuals’ lives beyond simple chip fabrication.

In their fight against a rogue corporate entity looking to capitalize on their innovations, the team endeavors to salvage Ava's mental resiliency and rectify students ground down by unattainable baseline vertices of societal intervention and standards clamoring for the Ideal. With competing factions now at the threshold threatening to cave the morality of restitution, Leon concocts a plan to confront the uncanny resonance influencers responsible for spatial disruptions that comprise loose drains Culmill capsules—and decumulate income while Tala's calls rejected patient revolts pressurizing their crisis of conscience, seeking reality overshot management office workload as budding sensations reprized emerge amidst betrayals amid pressures captained dreams of invisibly fired scenarios flurrying about.

Ultimately, Leon earns hard decisions when answers didn’t invade the plateaus neglected earlier. He unravels the ethical cadences enveloping the Forever Smile program when Ava, rescued from both her desperate world along with evolving burdens, reclasses acceptance focused on embracing positivity entwined with selves and memories or appearances dispersed in achievements before their final transformation lenses flickscreens eclipsed radiant bystanders drug-age slurry.
