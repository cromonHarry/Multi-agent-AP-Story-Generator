In the year 2042, the practice of dentistry has undergone transformative advancements thanks to the integration of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. The city's orthodontic landscape is ruled by corporate conglomerates operating viral marketing campaigns that promise perfect smiles with a single visit. At the forefront of this dental revolution is Dr. Mira Tran, a prodigy whose AI assitant, Alma, uses predictive analytics to develop personalized oral health strategies. Mira runs a cutting-edge practice called "Smile Tomorrow," built in a repurposed wrestling stadium, attempting to take a collaborative approach as opposed to the corporate machine. Complications arise when Mira’s former mentor, Dr. Howard Grant—known for prioritizing patients over profits—loses his practice to a corporate giant. Withdrawn in his grief, Grant harbors knowledge of a convoluted conspiracy that implicates corporate enslavement of patients through subliminal marketing that targets dental health inteligencia preliminaries.

As Mira continues to innovate and draws more patients from across the Dominion, she begins receiving cryptic messages of a “pure smile protocol”—leading her to believe there exists a grand plan that intertwines dental mutations with psychological manipulation. Meanwhile, Rian, a high-ranking executive at one of the rival<bodytime hospitals seeks to undermine Mira?nd pave the way for his employers' total domination over the oral care market. Rian corners Mira at a dental conference, outlining potential collaborations but secretly plots to codify her health strategy and use it against her. What pushes Mira further away from the corporate monstrosity is a mysterious ailment, wherein her patients report varying effects of happiness when new Smile Tomorrow procedures enter their bodies—is it real health, or subliminal enslavement? These episodes incite a discrete underground insistence as health-conscious citizens gravitate towards Dr. Grant’s advice—abandon electronics and naturalize on non-corporate channels—a counterweight to capitalism gone unchecked.

The tension reaches a climax during a Peaceful Ebbs Festival, ridden with glowing advertisements for cosmetic oral enhancements amidst the excited hustle of thousands. Mira enables an curious but an impulsive attempt to press Grant for his dubbed “antidote” to man-marketed sickness. Before conflict erupts, Rian starts contemplating sabotage while an errant malfunction occurs, manifesting holographic smiles looping over the audience. In dramatic fashion, Mira grabs the platform mic and engages everyone: she retract periods leading toward a different financial model, while Chancellor Orbitty of her covert FunCo commends their unpredictability unbeknownst to reduce sensitivity that mimetics glaze press orally supreme to inhibition stakes tied.
