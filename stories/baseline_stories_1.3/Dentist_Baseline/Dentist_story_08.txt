In the year 2045, dental technology has advanced significantly, reshaping the role of dentists and the experience of oral healthcare. Georgia Trent, a cutting-edge technologist and hygienist, resides in Neoma City, a sleek metropolis heavily interwoven with AI and biotechnology. In this world, dentists are now monitored by AI assistants that deliver instant diagnostics and augment treatment tools, rendering typical drills obsolete. Instead, clinics incorporate regenerative biotech—a means by which people can, in essence, repair their own teeth. Yet, the industry has become monopolized by a mega-corporation, BioDent, whose flagship figure, Dr. Adrián Malek, exerts considerable influence, pushing rapid profit over the ethics of human well-being. Sophia Verkin, an investigative journalist known for speaking out against corporate malfeasance, is determined to explore the dark underside of this utopian healthcare façade.

During a routine dental report at a so-called "Innovation Clinic," Georgia accidentally uncovers anomalies in patient records that implicate BioDent in grand-scale overdue finances and unsolicited cheap treatments leading to painful consequences for patients. Seeing Sophia Verkin's recent articles emphasizing skepticism regarding BioDent's practices streaming through his digital feeds rekindles a concept he'd buried. Remembering Dr. Malek’s dismissiveness a few visits earlier catalyzes his conviction that the healthcare sector they are scaling recklessly capitalizes on patients rather than serving them. Meanwhile, Sophia fields contact from Clifton Hale, a rare dental ethics professor ostracized by the field who offers damaging intel on ulterior corporate incentives, looking to publish a long-feared exposé. Convinced that taking the mega-corporation down could restore integrity and healing faith in dental practices, the line up a collaborative investigation that enunciates their individual pursuits for truth and integrity.

Adding tense operations to their plan, Georgia and Sophia go undercover in BioDent high-security manufacturing labs. Every heartbeat lodges pulling poisons of jeopardy—cycles of exposure to sonic technologies pulled from patients’ imperfect data leads them evidently north to unsafe treatments ignited by Alopecia implant fiascos.
