In the not-so-distant future, the profession of dentistry has evolved dramatically due to advancements in biotechnology and artificial intelligence. In Neo-Orthodontia, a sprawling megacity notorious for its obsession with aesthetics, harmful bacteria and tooth decay都 are near extinction thanks to the widespread implementation of Dental Nanobots—microscopic devices that continuously patrol the mouth, identifying and neutralizing threats before they escalate. An elite group of dental physicians called the Fab Four—Dr. Lyra Chen, a visionary genetic engineer; Dr. Timothy Graves, a charismatic biochemist who advocates for human enhancement; Maura Reyes, a former military operative turned resilience coach; and Harvey Vale, the cynical but brilliant AI technician—work together in a high-tech clinic revered for its game-changing treatment protocols.

One day, Dr. Chen discovers a hearing-entangled signal directed at The Teeth Registry, the database holding individuals' dental biosurveillance records. At first, what seems to her merely a network malfunction disrupts the equilibrium of the team, revealing a flaw in the regulation surrounding their beneficial nanobots—an issue capable of producing widespread dental emergencies. To address this alarming situation, the Fab Four launch an ingenuity-driven caper to dissect encoded signals while dodging corporate drones and pressure from financially motivated investors at Vyose Dental Tech, which proposes an unauthorized upgrade to escape into and pitch the lucrative "Nano Smile." Additionally, Maura encounters signs bacterium anomalies blooming in psychiatric patients; this alarming discovery challenges future perceptions about AI dental policing that protects healthy growth in the population while raising existential implications.

As rising industry pressure mounts, the group initiates a heist tosource like unauthorized servers hoarding crucial dental outcomes data manipulated by existentialist resonances. Their mission quickly turns precarious when they learn that Harvey's old contact, Dr. Anton Salvo, a corrupted figure and wellness prefector of Vyose, has sinister plans to release "retro-variant" nanobots into public drinking supplies, destabilizing population health and altering personal metadata through imposed primarily aesthetic corrections. Racing against time, the team experiences internal conflicts over the ideals of preservation worthiness for seamless smiles and ingress moral contracting set separately against mandatory hygienics practices. Meanwhile, turmoil unleashes enveloping integral doubt among the ranks leading to distrust, with some contemplating surrender while harmoniously trying to relay Anna Binn as the team's foundation against those faced ill-balanced communication forever within outrage situations truly risking clinics contracting.

With moments approaching their window for the attack, inspired by their varied backgrounds and unsettled alliances, the Fab Four launch a daring infiltration in Vyose’s central Covid-257 servedbeiterfiles servers.
