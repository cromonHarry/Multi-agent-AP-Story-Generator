In the year 2045, dental care has transformed from the sterile environments of the past into a cornerstone of emotional and mental health in society. The role of the dentist has evolved into that of a Therapeutic Clinical Specialist, whose duties extend beyond mere oral hygiene means; dentists now deploy tech-infused sensory experiences to make check-ups enjoyable. The protagonist, Dr. Luna Ferris, is a pioneer in this field, integrating AI-driven holograms that custom-tailor immersive environments according to patients’ past experiences and preferences. Alongside her are her fellow practitioners: Dr. Raj Malhotra, a whimsical inventor obsessed with gadgets that supposedly enhance oral health, Zoe Larks, an empathetic therapist who doubles as a community advocate, and Khalil Young, a technician with a longing to apply advanced cybernetics within dental practice. They work together at "Smile Sciences," a cutting-edge clinic known for its triumphant success in not just dental health but as purveyors of mental fortitude.

Behind this issue is a tech cyborg organization led by a charismatic CEO called Chambers, who profits from emotional turbulence generated by electric tooth replacements. Dr. Ferris, skeptical of the commodified ideal of a smile, tries to rally her colleagues with crop science research to strategize a counter-narrative—the integrity of dental care stems from natural health and community support rather than industry pressures.
