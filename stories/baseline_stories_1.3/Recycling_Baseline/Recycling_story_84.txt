In the year 2045, society has undergone a radical transformation due to collapsing resources and crippling pollution levels. Advanced recycling technologies have flourished and replaced traditional waste management systems, giving rise to ReclaimCorp, a colossal conglomerate dominating recyclables and their repurposing processes. Everyday items can be turned back into their raw elemental state through an intricate network of nanobots. Post-recycling, cities glimmer as buildings, vehicles, and electronic devices shimmer with the mantra: “Everything is Renewed, Nothing is Wasted.” Among those in this new world are Zane, a ReclaimCorp engineer passionate about innovating waste capture; Layla, a street artist who finds art in castaways; Tony, a former environmental activist whose acclamation has now turned to disillusionment; and Nyssa, an underground hacker seeking to expose how recycled materials are being exploited in an elaborate scam.

As resources dwindle thanks to ReclaimCorp's control, whispers trickle through underground channels about possible fraud in their recycling methods. Zane uncovers information insinuating that the company isn't redistributing adequate materials back to manufacturers and is turning 'recycled' products back into raw waste—all while propelling deception on an environmental recovery front. Determined to expose the misuse of their coveted tech, Zane communicates with Layla, encouraging her to channel her artistic talents into high-profile activism, drawing attention to what lies behind the company's glossy advertisements and greenmdash;filled speeches. Layla sees this opportunity not merely as street performance but a significant cultural statements. Julianna, a rival company player competing for manipulation of data surrounding freak accidents involving their competed designs intrigues Nyssa and serves as an uncommon ally.
