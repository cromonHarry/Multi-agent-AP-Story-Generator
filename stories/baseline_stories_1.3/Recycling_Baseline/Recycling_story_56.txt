In the year 2055, Earth has undergone a transformation sparked by the Great Plastic Reforms, an initiative that discarded traditional recycling methods in favor of bio-molecular equipment known as Alchemical Recyclers. Instead of being sorted, plastics and other waste are disassembled at the molecular level within these machines and refashioned into fresh raw materials or innovations, such as food, clothing, and even architecture. The bustling metropolis of Neo-Tokyo stands as the model city, showcasing innovative structures composed entirely of repurposed waste. Within this city, we meet our four protagonists: Kai, a passionate environmental activist; Livia, a corporate scientist driving the newest recycling technology; Ren, a street-smart scavenger who collects unprocessed waste, and Taro, a government official managing waste legacy funds. As interest grows around the efficiency of the recyclers, unforeseen complications begin to surface.

Kai becomes increasingly aware of the rising problem of e-waste, which is only partially processed by the Alchemical Recyclers. Rumors disperse on the streets about the groundwater contamination, caused inadvertently by chemical agents left behind in the ground during the disassembly process. Concerned for the health of her city, Kai enlists the help of her best friend Livia. Upon her inability to fulfill Kai’s request for data on pollution concerns, Livia becomes torn between the success of the company’s shareholders driven by the corporation's ongoing sustainability initiatives and her moral hesitation coming from potential environmental ramifications. While reporting her concerns to Taro, he turns defensive in regard to corporate involvement in reducing pollution risk because both prosperity and industry collapse hang in the balance.

In their pursuit of answers, the trio is soon joined by Ren, who shares clandestine information from inside the e-waste reclamation process. Along the edges of Neo-Tokyo’s prosperity, Ren reveals the threat of a rogue faction that not only exploits the Recycling initiatives but profits through sabotage. As the tension escalates, a clandestine meeting results in a grave confrontation: Livia realizes that the very devices she's aided in building have permitted this economic sub-group to channel toxic resources elsewhere. When confronted with this reality, both Livia and Taro must answer to their eco-impact as the lining between revolution and restoration begins to fray decisively.

While struggling to navigate their crumbling alliances in Neo-Tokyo, the team embarks on an urgent mission to unearth the truth behind the harmful elements lingering in the recycled matter caused by the ecological misfortunes neglected by department regulations. Kai’s audible activism sweeps sparks across the rest of the citizens, inciting protests against chemical firms illuminating exposed fractures within the ineffectiveness of their standard recovery methods. Taro begins to walk the fence of politics, counting the votes against media condemnations as previous distrust morphs apace. Amid an explosion of unrest, Kai back channels communications with health experts leveraging into undercurrents withholding just meets surfacing chaotic discussions.
