In the year 2075, Earth has become a planet dominated by megacities, each competing with one another for resource sustainability. Humanity has perfected the art of recycling through Quantum Recomposition, a technology able to molecularly reassemble any waste into premium materials or objects. The RekoCorp conglomerate provides these services alongside its dark public image; the company controls over 70% of the recycling market. Among the skeptical citizens are Juno, a young up-and-coming environmental engineer; Samira, a dedicated journalist in search of the truth behind RekoCorp; Ari, Juno's best friend who believes in RekoCorp's benevolence; and Lonan, the enigmatic and world-weary tech scavenger longing to expose his important knowledge about RekoCorp and its recycling technology for the greater good.

As RekoCorp announces its newest Quantum Recomposer prototype, population excitement surges, fostering celebration in the streets of New Haven. While at a tech expo, Juno’s innovative designs catch the attention of executives grateful for a trustworthy expert who can showcase their accomplishments neatly repackaged. Samira stalls her investigative drive, however, her instincts prompting her to question the hidden side effects and massive resource expenditures of reprocessing waste. As she investigates deeper, touching old connections with confidential uncovered reports RekoCorp doesn’t make public, Samira begins to unravel proof directly linking an increasing number of unpleasant environmental phenomena to questionable recycling efforts. Meanwhile, Ari becomes influenced by Samira's concerns, igniting the feelings of distrust they had previously buried.

The stakes escalate when Linx, Juno’s competing engineering mentor, reveals that RekoCorp’s reprocessing technologies are causing rare earth element deficiencies and affecting species longevity. Prompted by examples of devastated communities near RekoCorp recycling plants, Juno and Samira scramble to prove this somber truth. During an underground scoring expedition, Lonan presents evidence that hints towards bribery, sabotage, and human rights abuses entangled with RekoCorp’s interests. Educated and passionate, the joined trio decide it’s imperative to clandestinely infiltrate RekoCorp’s headquarters to find proof of their latest destructive claim: Quantum Recomposer malfunctioning leads to wave harvested rebusiness technoculturations threatening numberless lower-income city refugees as the affluent embrace illusions of a green parallel existence.

Navigating through high-security measures within RekoCorp bottles it up not just mere technological inaccuracies, presenting Section XV—a haze laboratory tied to mysterious orders sent down crystal red rails. Bodies absent but still implicitly assigned behaviors which represent annihilated manipulations as disfigured waste builders venture over broken off crafts stood dispensed like else empire trades of opportunity.
