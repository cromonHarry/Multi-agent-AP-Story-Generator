In a not-so-distant future, Earth has been noticeably transformed by a society obsessed with recycling and sustainability. New Earth Federation (NEF) governs this technological paradise with the ethos of "Waste No More," advocating for a world where everything discarded can be reengineered into something usable. Simultaneously, a pervasive holographic advertising network promotes a life devoid of waste through interactive platforms all around, even calling down offers of instant reparations in education to further the recycling goal. Here, we meet Jade, a passionate eco-engineer striving to improve the tech; Rich, her skeptical brother, questioning the profit-driven motives behind these green initiatives; Olivia, a master recyclist twin born with the gift to reconfigure waste at oxide molecular levels; and Tobias, an eccentric scavenger who unearths hidden remnants of past civilizations to fuel electric dreams.

One day, Jade stumbles upon a database revealing that their remarkable recycling technology hides a terrifying secret: the major recycling corporations are using pollutants collected to create synthetic biomass admixed with dangerous payloads, which could disrupt Neo Earth’s biological integrity. With Rich agreeing, though reluctantly, to help her expose this reality, they enlist the gifted Olivia, hoping she can reverse-engineer one of NEF’s “advanced” bio-products sampled by Jade. Still struggling against misconceptions of their endeavor's morality, Olivia grows attached to the idea of unraveling this cynical business backbone—that's where resources literally don’t wear out but transform utterly. Tobias becomes drawn into the group; after meeting Olivia at a scrap solar farm, he senses her motivations but hides profound knowledge of what they’ll soon experience—little do they know, he himself has GhostEM technology capable of pinning the worth of true transformation on mere chaos.

Tension mounts as the four delve deeper, tracing corrupt episodes emanating from the public-facing architecture dedicated to “ethical recycling.” A series of strikes disrupt major production yields during their expedition across the archipelago of manufacturing plants. A gut-wrenching unity reveals tributaries with secret upgrades found running through their cities with shocking alerts glinting modern II algorithm malls led by their rivals. They uncover cabalistic relationships and clandestine assembly lines waiting to hoard their potential knowledge, errant to the sound of compliance clamping capital materials and manipulated populist politics hindering their revolt against the assumed righteousness harried by their burdens of consumption around these grim landfill robots.

The epiphany strikes our heroes when people iDetroit-skate—prove heavily initiated applause being mere stocking titan manufacturers waiting to engage; reveals ominous plans expanding into underground retreat portals. This accidentally puts them at odds with their father, the growing influence of one Coulter Peters—leading society culture unattached many NFD propaganda. In a chaotic tribunal oozing with drama and backup from marginalized communities who progressively ‘truthichoiced’ themselves apocalyptic toward pure domiciles canvassing their cobweb written waste identities instead. Mire lingers heavily reverberated as struggle births apocalyptic volatility with open battle-lines: Kyle defactures the recycling engines while our lead-thrust wins symptoms disrest to repurpose hyper-contention resilient seals off toxic seed alliances.
