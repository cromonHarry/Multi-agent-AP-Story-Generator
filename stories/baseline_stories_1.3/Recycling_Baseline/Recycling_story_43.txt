In the year 2045, society operates in a world governed by the principles of cyclical living. Nearly every item is designed for disassembly and repurposing. An advanced company, TerraCycle Corp, utilizes nanotech enabled recycling devices called Recycler Units, which can break down materials at the molecular level in homes around the globe. Among the Ukiya residential block’s many inhabitants is Indigo Wei, an ambitious president of a local recycling cooperative, Harmony. She has always held a strong belief in true circular economy practices. Alongside her are Jay, her eco-engineer partner who works tirelessly on sustainability tech but raises nagging concerns about corporate motives; Native, a literal Dog-Rover—an AI robot companion programmed to efficiently assist in domestic recycling; and Meris, a rogue inventor with a penchant for creating extravagant gadgets from recycled materials who creates tension between profitability and the environmental mission.

When TerraCycle announces plans to initiate a widespread rollout of urban recycling hubs, completed with Stage IV Recycler Units designed to radically increase waste processing efficiency, Indigo rushes to collaborate with them for a pilot project in Ukiya. As Indigo passionately works with TerraCycle to pen a visionary proposal, Jay cautions her about their corporate incentives, worried their upward drive would overshadow grassroots initiatives like Harmony. Meanwhile, Meris becomes inspired to galvanize people into taking DIY recycling into their own hands, creating locally constructed units made from scrap. Tensions boil as Indigo unveils her project at a community meeting, garnering conflicting responses from locals caught between impending innovation and deprived possibilities for their persistent realities.

The time comes for the first recycling hub to launch. Anticipation is high; crowds gather eagerly, but when the new Recycler Units go online, a catastrophic coding glitch in the technology instantaneously renders a majority of Ukiya's refuse unusable — summoned into a swirling, confused mess that sparks riot warning signals. Local citizens are outraged as their organic waste disappears along with efficiencies believed just days prior. Now grappling with the chain echo of mass waste, Indioglanti girds the locals hoping to reshape the future dialogue. Mistrust brews among the people as they start to blame mega-corporations like TerraCycle, inadvertently weakening communal firing codes Jelly and Native questions machines flooding personal landscapes revealing a mish-mash of choices.

Working together, Indigo’s team—relying on their diverse skills—confronts the failing Scanner-Sort-Series inciting deteriorative issues aplenty.
