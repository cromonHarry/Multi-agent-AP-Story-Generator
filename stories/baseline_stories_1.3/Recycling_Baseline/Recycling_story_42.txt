In the year 2087, the world has transformed into a hyper-connected society bound by an intricate Recycling Nexus, an intelligent network that processes nearly all materials—biological, electrical, and chemical—into new forms with minimal waste. Society has evolved to rely heavily on Repurposers, specialized individuals with biotech suits that enhance their abilities to scavenge and convert items deemed waste into usable resources. Ava, a young and passionate Repurposer, is determined to make a name for herself in Millenarian City, where innovation thrives. Alongside her colleagues, Zane, a quirky eco-engineer struggling with the ethical complications of recycling technology, Theo, a charismatic Leader of an underground waste reclamation group known as “The Choir,” and Elise, an ambitious Corporate Recycler looking to profit from the more toxic remnants of society, they each navigate their roles in the grand recycling scheme.

Ava becomes embroiled in a race against deception when she accidentally discovers underground mines rich with "bio-synths," genetically modified organisms powerful enough to break down the toughest materials into renewable energy. These organisms have repairing properties that help counteract disaster, but they are also coveted for advanced materials that compete against the severely limited resources supplied by corporations like Elise's. Amplifying potential tensions, Zane unveils evidence that certain reclamation technologies have been rigged to favor corporations by allowing a blockchain technology monopoly over recycling materials. The fight becomes two-fold, leading them deep into corporate warehouses casting shadows over local ecosystems. This alliances drama highlights cracks within their friendships; Sides begin being drawn as ideals clash over profits versus preservation.

As cracks fissile into foundational belief, tensions escalate and culminate when Ava and Zane uncover a location where True-Recyclers experiment on bio-synths in worst practices while Hydron tech — an advanced toxicity conversion operation ran arbitrarily by malfunctioning AI — aims to inject memory fragments into recycled materials that threatens to data-process human thoughts into AI and flesh. In order to save them, Ava must convince Theo and Zane to trust her plan as, for the Detox Mission, their goal blends human essence with pessimistic Res-technologies threatening liquidation dreams away into enigmatic energy beings suffocating society one Legokart garden at a time.
