In the year 2047, Earth’s population had doubled, and resources had dwindled to critical levels. To tackle the crisis, humanity leaned into technological advances and revolutionized the concept of recycling. In cityscapes where metal, plastic, and organic substances were reduced to a their base elemental components using massive Recyclon converters, refuse created a new form of currency, dubbed "ecotage." Kai, an innovative engineer obsessed with how ecological collapse forced humanity to innovate, often tinkered late into the evenings on enhancements to Recyclons at the Urban Ecotechnology Lab. His colleague Sophia, an insightful resource activist, dreamed of merging environmental ethics with ambitious tech advancements. Meanwhile, two famed scavengers, Rix and Lennox, navigated the trash-choked streets, salvaging reusable materials. Their exploits, both zealous and predicated on well-endowed technologies, raised exciting possibilities, drawing Kai into an unintended partnership.

One fateful evening, the ruins of a mysteriously abandoned Recyclon caught the four characters unaware as a broken transmitter crackled back to life amidst forgotten junk. Photos, corrupted details, and cryptic diagrams fragmented through time marked unexplored plans revealing that the device contained notorious pirating protocols capable of re-administrating essential resources directly to decentralized components across the continent. Awash with hybrid fierce ambition informed by ethics, Sophia advocated utilizing them for public communal strength. Alternately impassioned, Rix sought to monopolize the scheme, eager at the prospect of playing king and ether patrolling their scrapyard territories. An internal divide brewed within their ranks and mirrored societies spent sulking behind walls fashioned from desperate tools holding clashes over succeeded ideas and widespread heel-dragging bureaucracy controlling any forward impulse.
