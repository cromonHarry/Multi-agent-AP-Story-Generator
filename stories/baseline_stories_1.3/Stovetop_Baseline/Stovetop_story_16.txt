In the year 2045, the Earth is inhabited by an eclectic mix of augmented humans and innovative AIs. Technology has advanced significantly, and so too have day-to-day cooking methods. Gone are the days of simple stovetops; now culinary stations called “Stovetops” come equipped with holographic displays, robotic arms, and AI sensors that not only provide instructions but also virtually taste dishes for optimal outcomes. In the boutique culinary district of NeuCity, four aspiring chefs—Mira, an AI-whisperer; Jamal, an experimental chef; Kaito, a traditionalist with roots in ancient Asian cooking; and Nia, a nutrition specialist navigating food sustainability—dream of winning the prestigious Culinary Dominion. This annual tournament pits chefs against their own Stovetops, blending human creativity with artificial precision to create dishes out of ethical complexities and increasingly rare ingredients.

As the tournament date approaches, tension rises. Mira geeks out over troubleshooting software glitches in her Stovetop, believing a convergence of flavors when creating algorithmically innovative fusions will clinch her victory. Meanwhile, Jamal throws caution to the wind, concocting bizarre and fantastical dishes that mesmerize and simultaneously disturb the palate. He believes the tournament is as much about spectacle as it is about culinary tradition. Kaito struggles in this hypermodern era, clinging to techniques taught by his ancestors, but each demonstration shows him grappling with disdain from both judges and the audience for not adapting to the future. Nia, intent on raising awareness about sustainable practices, teams up with a non-profit environmental organization to ensure at least one dish in the competition embraces ingredients harvested from rooftop farms and vertical gardens of NeuCity.

The day of the competition dawns, filling the halls of the venue with a symphony of hisses, chopping sounds, and heady aromas created by the enmeshed neural networks of competing Stovetops—which have evolved pieces of socio-culinary knowledge from their creators. With an increasingly ravenous audience atop their monitors, tensions reach a tumultuous peak as a shocking rumor spreads: the Structural Ministry has announced last-minute ingredient compatibility restrictions for judges, falsifying fresh-source integrity much to help corporate sponsorships thrive. With hands trembling, each chef devises desperate last-minute changes; Mora’s innovative connection misfires, resulting in a robotic sifter gardening out foul hydrolayer revisions. Burnout claims Jamal just before service, while Nia scrambled for precise onboard AI calculations bends towards salad-cream monoliths surveyed botanically.

In the aftermath of the Culinary Dominion, the relationship between citizens and their evolved Stovetops shifts.
