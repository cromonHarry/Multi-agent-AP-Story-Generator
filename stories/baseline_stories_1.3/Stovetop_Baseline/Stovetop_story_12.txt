In the year 2045, technology has reshaped daily life to such an extent that food preparation has become almost entirely automated. In the Urban Sublime district of what was once known as Los Angeles, savvy modern chefs like Zara harness the incredible power of “stovetop synths”—cutting-edge appliances that meld material sciences with AI, allowing for the creation of culinary masterpieces with neither mess nor effort. Each stovetop synth stands as a pillar in homes, facilitating the simultaneous cooking of dozens of gourmet recipes—from an aromatic truffle risotto to flash-fried tempura—with a mere touch or voice command. Zara’s friend Jonah is Design Liaison at SynthCulinary Inc., the leading company behind these innovations. However, one cold evening, at a festive dinner party, as Zara presents her latest ambitious dish, a catastrophic failure sets off the stove's fail-safes, poisoning the food with toxic chemicals.  Jonah reassures shy Butch, a plateman whose haptic-enhanced delivery would elevate the dining experience, embracing the puzzles digital world; but meanwhile, Ruby, an environmental activist, rants against the dependence on technology for cooking.

In the days that follow the toxic event, Zara experiences a surge of conflicting emotions. Determined not to let a malfunction jeopardize cuisines she once celebrated, she corrals her circle of friends—especially passionate Ruby, who staunchly speaks in favor of returning to traditional cooking methods. However, Jazz, once a teammate, sees opportunity where they weren’t looking: clashes occur as doubts mount about the ultimate safety and ethics surrounding further doses of digital regimes that placate the senses. Curious notions emerge over a trip neither character wanted (Butch remains just a little helpless).

That’s when, during a pivotal pitching event, Zara harnesses sheaves of synthesis prowess orchestrating intense euphoria to finish Rory wave tech submission.
