In the year 2045, cooking has transformed into an art governed by technology, with most homes equipped with advanced “smart-stovetops." These devices not merely heat food but draw on a vast database that supplies personalized recipes and 3D prints dishes using assorted nano-ingredients stored within the unit. A conflict between tradition and progress brews when Gregor Reyes, a food historian and purist, fights to preserve ancient cooking methods from being overshadowed by robotic culinary wizards. Joining him is Diane Chong, a proponent of technological advances, who believes in blending cultural culinary heritage with futuristic gastronomical interpretations. Their worlds collide when Stovify, a powerful tech conglomerate, unveils its latest product that has the potential to change home cooking forever—to the point that it can recreate the taste of nostalgic meals from just an individual's memory.

As the debate intensifies in the progressive city of Neo-Tokyo, Gregor and Diane find themselves reluctantly teaming up after an old friend, Amir Hossain, an engineer, discovers alarming data. Using Stovify’s new household culinary AI, people have begun using social credit to get tastes analogous to their memories instead of actually cooking meals, which is embedding emotional reliance on software rather than personal creativity. Gregor feels betrayed, viewing the evolution as erasure of the very stories and bonds that meals foster. Conversely, Diane maintains her enthusiasm, arguing that inefficiencies in traditional cooking wasted resources. Things veer downward when Leyla Moreau, a talented food artist powerful in sensory expressions, announces revolutionary techniques for her showcases only on Stovify products, solidifying the public inclination toward ease over effort.

With the launch of the flagship Stovify unit across urban centers on the horizon, tensions culminate in a public debate scheduled in the grand park spiraling down promptly into chaos. During their argument, Gregor implapses after denouncing consumerism and the convenience as anti-cultural. Caught off-guard, Diane ties an emotional appeal around cooking as “the last breastplate of familial memory,” but as sprites populated with meal memories whirl above ahead shapes riding eyes looking for richness beyond provided haste.
