In the year 2045, the skyline of Neo-Tokyo shimmered with augmented reality billboards and aerial drones weaving through the twilight. In this world, cooking had evolved far beyond its humble origins. The newest marvel, designed by BioCore Industries, was the AI sentience meal system, known as "Stovetop," an advanced culinary AI that could analyze a person's DNA and tailor each dish for optimal nutrition and taste. Four students from the Culinary Institute of Artifice - Yasuo, Rina, Omar, and Mei - banded together for a competition to determine who could create a unique recipe worthy of the Stovetop competition prize, a coveted award in an ever-digitizing culinary landscape.

Under the glow of their holopads, Yasuo and Mei had dreams of becoming renowned chefs, not as eaters but as creators of holographic food that would make flavors generationally accessible. Omar, who represented the older generation in their group, expressed skepticism; virtual dishes devoid of true cooking in the traditional sense felt hollow to him. Rina championed the modernization, dazzling her friends with ideas on programmable garnishes that altered the meal's appearance for each relayer. Since founding their gastronomic platform on the island below Metonic Towers, anxious feeling buzzed, each participant had a growing sense that the paradigm of existence and tradition was slipping away with each bow tie they fashioned to submit their recipes into the Stovetop balance log.

As the weeks progressed, dynamic tension built within the team. Yasuo delved deep into unexpected styles, but Omar cautioned him against losing the essence of food, fervently resisting experimenting far-spread food fusions without first grounding solutions into localness. Under pressure, the friendship began to fray; peoples' motivations faltered under timing and scrutiny—and soon the competition heated an unrelentingly intense flame, set to plan a big dinner evening showcase. As preparations steeped with emotion, conversations leaning toward pity for Omar dominated every kitchen corner. Seeking clarity, while the evening ruled with markets docking aromas of flame-infusing flambés sometimes even brought to stubborn riverside memories of success flourishing in one's kichen.
