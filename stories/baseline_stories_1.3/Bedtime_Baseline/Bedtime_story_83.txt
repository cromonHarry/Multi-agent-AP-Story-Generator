In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed remarkably. People reside in Lumina Heights, a city governed by artificial intelligence, where every aspect of life is carefully regulated through two-hour vignettes assigned to individuals before using their HoverBeds — biometrically integrated sleep capsules that not only provide rest but interact dynamically with the occupant’s mind. In this world, four friends — Zara, an app developer; Kieran, a nightly storyteller interested in A.I. narratives; Lina, an interactive experience designer; and Nia, a journalist exploring societal shifts — frequently gather for their discussions, curious about how the sanctity of sleep has changed over the years. Although drawn together by a mutual fascination, they each hold different perspectives on their new reality.

The friends remain fascinated by reports of individuals unhappy with the increased reliance on synaptic bed therapy, a function of the HoverBeds that records and manipulates relaxation and evolving creation, sowing seeds of creativity into rest-moments. Zara can't believe others scoff at this innovation, explaining to Kieran, Lina, and Nia how sleep became deep-lore casting vibrant sectors for artisanal dreams. Simultaneously, Kieran's project inspires him to create accessible bedtime stories, influencing the automated narrative woven within each sleeping experience. One fateful night, their conversations draw them to a controversial gathering led by a renowned philosopher proclaiming the dangers of hyperstone sleep integration—the whole packaging of packaged designer dreams that “limits spontaneity and contemplative rest.”

The climax leaps as their conversations spark a tense debate: whether embodiment equals distinct humanity. On a nodding thrill, Kieran introduces the “Dream Snapp,” which harnesses the collective night experiences to narrate stories, dragging the dream tapestry into reels played on-screen at local events. Zara throws her apprehension into the other's foamy suspicions—what happens to imagination when it's curated so carefully? As the four wrestle with existential repercussions created within thoughts processed through beds, Nia proposes risking the measure—the group diverges, daring user experimentation to dimension true freedom in purposefully jumbled wake-sleep regimes override their commedieself interpretations.
