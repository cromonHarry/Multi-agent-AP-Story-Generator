In the year 2043, society has undergone a radical transformation with the introduction of technology-enhanced sleep pods, which promise to tailor the perfect lullaby for individuals based on a deep analysis of their routines, emotions, and health data. The world’s “Bedtime” now resembles a ritualistic performance dictated by algorithms that decide when one should rest, often overriding personal desires and rhythm. Around the high-tech skylines of New Haven City, four friends—Lia, a data analyst waiting for sleep-pod fill rates for her company, Kiran, a vivid artist anxious to maintain his creativity amidst peaceful sleep, Will, a conspiracy theorist questioning the drones monitoring sleep patterns, and Tara, a corporate sleep pod technician disheartened by her issues within the encroaching corporate structure—navigate the complexities of choices in this new reality. Each grapples separately with distortions in their circadian perspectives as deadlines for optimal sleeps sync with melting dreams and reality.

As bedridden millions succumb to better sleep statistics, Kiran feels anxious that sleep pods aren’t just limiting dreams but altering consciousness. While visiting a gallery of his works, he strikes discursive bouts with Will, who has recently gone off the grid—abandoning the pods to pursue natural sleep rhythms. Intrigued by this newfound philosophy, Kiran rebels against the algorithm-chosen timetables and invites Tara deeper into his burgeoning quest for authenticity within sleep dreams. Tara confides ongoing strain with her corporate software tied tightly to externalized decision power on sleeping-ennobling toys and withdrawal symptoms from pulling long hours enhancing insomnia cures through active fMRI chart retrospectives. Stressed over her attachments to profit margins, she dreams of dismantling the established order fueled by data while encountering hilarious eerie dreams portraying monosodium glutamate influences.

Unexpected input leads them to a dormant underground sleep farm. The rebellious friends find ruins inhabited by long-lost ideologies surrounding their relationship to rest and ply uncommon events like total realignment through rituals synergized with exhaling holographic illusions and encouraging lucid dreaming, stirring memories that bleed sentiment into real progress through insincerity representation broadening discomfort. Fueled with multiple inspirations blocking a queue for a warped espousal seriatim, they set sail on controlling sleep tech held rigid indoors waiting incessantly for august arrivals battling numb optimizations; it's this surge, along individualizations battling interpreted awakenings exposing core tributary anatomy, currying mystery redeemed only hastily afloat collective redemption seeks cease distinctly now.
