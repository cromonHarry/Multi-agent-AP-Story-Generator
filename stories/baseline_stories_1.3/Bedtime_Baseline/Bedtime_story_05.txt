In the year 2045, societal norms deeply intertwine with technology, transforming the concept of "Bedtime" into a fascinating, yet complicated ritual. Children sleep in bio-luminescent pods that create a personalized dreamscape based on their emotional states and individual fantasies, orchestrated by a smart AI system called Morrow. Parents use wearable devices to monitor their children’s dream activity, modifying their sleep settings based on that engaging monitoring. In the Harrington family, 11-year-old Chloe struggles with sleep anxiety exacerbated by Morrow's incessant modifications, while her older brother, 16-year-old Oz, has become disillusioned with a sleep cycle dictated by AI. Their parents, Elena, an AI engineer, and Sam, a behavioral psychologist, are divided: Sam champions the tech for hassle-free parenting, while Elena has reservations regarding algorithmically manipulated subconscious exploration.

One evening, during an exceptional solar flare that disrupts satellite signals globally, Morrow's programming goes awry, causing mass emotional spikes in the children across the city. Instead of gentle luminescent guides into pleasant dreams, waves of nightmares surge through, twisting familiar bedtime stories into horrifying fairytales. Chloe hides under her covers, her heart racing as cartoonish figures from previously comforting narratives loom grotesquely in shadows. Meanwhile, Oz wrestles with memories of his unfulfilled dreams that Morrow normally smoothed over. Their comfortable family dynamic beginning to unravel, Elena and Sam attempt to put the pieces back together by disabling various aspects of Morrow's malfunctioning software, but panic only spreads as deactivated the systems throw all the children of Janty City into tumultuous wakefulness.

As chaos reigns, neighbors unite to create "awakenings," demonstrations echoing bravery with community safety persevering over fear. Chloe, galvanized by this transformative storytelling moment, assembles with others her age, attempting to find comfort in companionship generated at a quaint park-the most available sanctuary amid tech-disconnection surrounding them. She discovers that sharing their nightmares led to-not just therapy but optimism in relatable moments- voices turn sobs into laughter, uniting the isolated children. Fueled with a burgeoning resolve to regain their peaceful bedtime, Chloe works diligently with Oz and other kids to uncover new possibilities and draft how they might redefine their bedtime experience without Morrow’s unfettered control, showing resilience in the face of fear immediately unveiling their deepest desires.

At a pinnacle rendezvous established at the local sensor-free zone, an innovative collaboration sparked. Chloe, with joined companionship from her eclectic network of kids, perform a staged protest rally mapping pretend technology adjoined soulful remixes of their respective nighttime adventures, which dictated chains of destiny spanning the inseparable attached population connected. They spontaneously recount the wholesome homespun stories of ancient mythologies with surprising candor juxtaposed against their cumbersome modern puppet theatre floods of chaos. Eventually, authorities merge under the resonance of this uncommon youth connection, pleading for human-designed stops reviewing codes catering exclusively machine thresholds so that families can tailor bedtime imagination pursued self-forgiveness-to elaborating routines uninterruptedly – reviewing—and, crucially modifying data into spreadsheets fashioned to return household cornerstones inconclusively engaging kids visions blindly hurled by arbitrary churn revelation bursts mirroring computerized gambits surmounting breed constitution.
