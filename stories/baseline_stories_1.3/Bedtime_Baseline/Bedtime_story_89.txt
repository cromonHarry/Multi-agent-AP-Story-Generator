In the year 2042, the concept of bedtime has drastically evolved in a world dominated by Artificial Intelligence and personalized experiences. The Global Rest Initiative (GRI) has replaced the traditional notion of sleep with an advanced system of "Cognitive Rest Assists" (CRAs) designed to optimize human efficiency during what was once known as sleep hours. Anne, a sleep scientist slighted by the new regime, struggles with her fading passion as CRAs induce various dream states, artificially manipulating rest patterns. Her brilliant partner, Mark, a leading CRA developer, believes the technology is enhancing human potential. Their rebellious teenage daughter, Terra, eschews conventional norms and yearns to experience “natural” sleep, reveling in no longer adhering to enforced nightly schedules. Meanwhile, Ethan, a factory worker and an early adopter of the CRAs, contemplates his growing dependency on the matrix of simulated dreams that fill his nights.

Conflict arises when a significant technological malfunction across the city disrupts CRAs and plunges millions into a sleepless frenzy. In the chaos, forced to confront the genuine consequences of his invention, Mark rallies alongside Anne to investigate the core malfunctions in hope of restoring the city's ability to sleep without mediation. Amid their quest, Terra explores underground organizations that reject controlled sleep, instead valuing the authentic unconscious experience, led by figurehead activist Raiden. Though drawn into the allure of philosophical inquiries underscored by experience-abandoning hunger, Terra watches hundreds lose their sense of identity as memories blur under forced dreaming.

As they uncover factors leading to the breakdown of CRAs—both recently detrimental software updates and corporate greed by GRI—the familial schism in beliefs-becomes palpable. On one side is Terra, begging them to embrace pre-CRA concepts of sleep restoration; on the other is Mark, desperate for redemption from faulty technology, convinced the entire family must guide society back into the fold of engineered dreaming. The clash sharpens when a covert operation leads to revelations that thorough testing never preceded a pivotal software release. As mass protests demand unconditional access to “normal” requests for slumber unfold throughout the city, families split into warring ideologies.

In a leaping moment that cements ideals against disillusionment, worst comes to worst when, in a climactic genius-meets-momentum moment, chaos exposes vulnerabilities that the society has inattentively snored into existence. Desperate to asperse the divided household, Anne calculates a radical algorithm, “True Sleep,” buffering forsaken dream spaces filled by the reclamation of an organic subconscious. United against societal doubt, Mark and Anne finally formulate a workaround that enables humanity to regain their relationship with unphony night sleep once more while shuttering the arhythmic dependence on their creations. Terra possesses an unexpected revelation amongst assembly mystique, that sleep and consciousness actually necessitate distinct yet mutually honoring systems.

Under the revived blue moonlight breaking through recalls land of the rightfully known sun, families begin to recover from enforced madness as Critical Rest Communication socio-eyed dialectal balancing acts arise all throughout society’s sundry gatherings. Discussions weave past misplaced trust into fraternal leads, gently smoothing resurgence led by enhancing the sleep orbits of their starry-eyed trivium.
