In the year 2045, sleep has become a commodity more precious than gold. The invention of the SleepSync device, a neural interface that optimizes sleep cycles and enhances dreams, has transformed how society views rest. This technology creates an elite class of hyper-productive individuals who meld pleasure and work in artificially enhanced states of mind. Morning Dusk, a 30-something dream architect, struggles with recalling the impact of sleep in the rise of newly-famous ‘energizers’ and obsession over productivity. After months of reliance on SleepSync to cope with stressful deadlines and societal expectations, she starts to question who she is when her device malfunctions, awakening her long-forgotten memories of a world in which sleep was a cherished and ancient ritual.

Not far away, Jaxon, a compassionate mechanic who works a humble repair job for fading technology, crosses paths with Morning when she comes in days after her glitch began causing her distressing dreams—visions entwining her life with deep-seated fears and lost memories. Unknown to them, they are bound by a complex history: Jaxon’s younger sister, Elara, abandoned her family years ago. As an unrepentant rebel against societal norms, she believes in a different approach—one where sleep and processes inspired by it hold healing, not restriction. When Morning partly discovers an inheritance linking her life to the long-lost Elara, the opportunity emerges for the three to forge an alliance for a cause greater than themselves: revealing the harsh truth about humanity's obsession with the engineered experience of sleep and its stultifying dominance over organic life.

As the trio prepares to expose how pervasive technology has whisked away genuine bedtime bonds of simplicity—stories, lullabies, laughter—with ruthless implications, they formulate a plan. The rebellious haven, Sleepalora, lies hidden under the technocratic city, steered by Elara and a small community purging tech addiction so they can re-establish authentic ways of dreaming, traditional bedtime rituals devoid of additives. 

The night of the climax, lit by vivid auroras from nearby sources energizing the skyline, tense as the characters scroll through jumbled memories and dark past experiences extracted during recycled sleep cycles, they confront the aristocrats behind the SleepSync conglomerate. They confront the oligarchy's hideous harvest finance models and invisible shackles creating rampant sleep deprivation for profits. During this poignant climax, factions clash violently as political authority pirouettes like starship wreckage against imagined dreams turned nightmares. Morning, primarily shattered, channels Elara’s brilliance, pulling War Propagation into the static fevered struggles around the mystery lie detection—slowly aiding collective intelligence summarizing collective trauma yet subtly spurning industrial exploits.

With the showdown reaching a transcendent beyond tension wrestling, self-revelation manages to severated agency plaguing individuals across lives played within walls of tech command from multiple pathways. Just as victories bloom from muddled measures taken, success stirs slow ebb, sleep-find where real floods resurgence inthe warming nebula glows a steady solace Where connection supersedes){
