In the year 2045, nighttime has been revolutionized by the introduction of a collective sleep technology known as Somnolink, enabling individuals to connect their consciousness while they sleep. Families share psychological experiences in vivid, dreamlike bodies shared in custom VR layers. Among these, a tired single mother, Layla, relishes the idea of bonding with her children, 10-year-old Maya and 7-year-old Jace, all while Sal, a cheerful neighbor-financing engineer looking for acceptance, observes their nightly rituals. Each night at precisely 9 PM, Layla connects with her children in Somnolink, where dreams script educational adventures ensuring they rise the next day with broader insights and a sense of fulfillment, nourished not just in their waking life but through conscious cosmic interplay.

As the clock strikes bedtime, the kids, entranced by the social algorithms embedded in their devices, drift from the natural arts of thinking creatively towards a manufactured whimsy. Sal, longing for an intimate connection since migrating from the suburbs, tempts Layla into a conversation about exploring San Zano, the enigmatic forest realm housed within Somnolink. Curiosity piqued, both agree to broaden their nightly palette, welcomed to Similkra, where vibrant colors shift melod compositions integral to flying upon downy-based aircraft amid clouds of cottoned warmth. However, tensions arise as familial bonds begin splintering under the weight of hyper-customization; experiences seem more real than genuine ones, and laughter blends with faint murmurs of unease.

Within this dreamy hybrid universe crafted from artificial phenomena, the anxiety of clashing realities mounts. An error in the Somnolink interface starts plaguing their nightly escapades. Rather than yun intending carbon commerce routes amidst debilitating vegetation, they want reconciliation before real love dissolved them.
