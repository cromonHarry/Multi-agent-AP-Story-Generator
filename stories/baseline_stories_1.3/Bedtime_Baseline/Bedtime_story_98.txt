In the year 2050, society has redefined the concept of "Bedtime". With the rapid advancement of neuroscience, people no longer need to sleep conventionally. Instead, they plug into omnipresent Sleep Pods designed to induce lucid dreaming experiences tailored to the individual’s needs and desires. These immersive escapades have become integral to both mental health and social status. Lila, a skilled pod designer, believes passionately in the therapeutic potential of these dreamscapes. Her partner, Arun, serves as the head of HealConnect—a biotech company producing content for the pods. Meanwhile, artistic genius Eli, a childhood friend of Lila, struggles to channel his creativity in the blank expanse of reality, frequently losing himself in his vivid dreams. However, there's also Mira, a rebellious teen determined to restore the lost art of real sleep, rejecting numbing escapes in favor of human connection.

As Lila unveils her latest innovative pod creation, the Dreamiverse—a program that combines therapy, mystery, and personal growth in sleepscapes—a tension brews among her friends. Arun supports Lila’s vision but sees the Dreamiverse's success hinging on social influencers using it. This spurs Eli, desperate for his lost imagination, to wish for Lila’s unswayed attention. As the immediate popularity of the Dreamiverse overshadows real face-to-face relationships, the trio ambivalently drift apart. This unsettles both Lila and Arun, but ultimately gives Mira fuel for her anti-pod crusade, a movement encouraging youth to reclaim their bedtime as an organic and restorative opportunity for social engagement, rebuffing the mechanization of dreams.

Increasing controversy escalates as two opposing movements rise in the city—a divisive facility providing traditional sleep therapy in one corner, while the staggering success of Sleep Pods blankets the streets in the other. Influenced and doping on healthy escapism becomes commonplace, leading to a total failure of authentic communication among members of society. Each increasingly encountering anxiety, Lila discovers their counterparts in dreaming hold deeper truths about her relationships; unwelcome realizations emerge from extensive perspective barriers. Under brisk rainone night, Eli approaches Mira after ceaseless disputes spread within her protest group on the futility of dreams and chipset rewilding—complicated by mistrust ruffled from feeling unexplored. A shared bedtime tradition between them resurfaces; it sparks sjourn invitation into her sanctuary for this rustic recreational environment.
