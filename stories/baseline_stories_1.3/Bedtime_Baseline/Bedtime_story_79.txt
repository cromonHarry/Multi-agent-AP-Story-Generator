In the year 2085, society has revolutionized the concept of bedtime, turning it into a scheduled, data-driven experience administered by specialized Sleep Architects using AI. Sleep, once a natural and comforting routine, is now optimized for productivity. People live in sleek, soundproof sleep pods that monitor every bodily function, analyzing optimal rest patterns via augmented reality interfaces. Each night, Jonathan, a stressed out workplace coach; Mia, a sleep-deprived mother of three, Luke, a teenage gamer escaping the rigors of his day-to-day life, and Eleanor, a curious pharmacologist seeking an edge in her research, surrender to machines for what is supposed to be restorative sleep yet leaves them yearning for something deeper and more meaningful.

As sleep optimization has skyrocketed mental, emotional, and psychological disturbances, Jonathan’s workshop—including Mia, Luke, and Eleanor—travels past branded pods to the Sleep-Attained Artifacts Museum where artifacts of natural sleeping habits are preserved. Eleanor searches the archive for pre-AI experiences, recalling how her earnest study of sleep was steered onto a profit path, while Jonathan grapples with his clients’ fading tranquility. Meanwhile, Mia reminisces around pre-caffeine lullabies, her children's refusal to latch onto sleep elevating her emotional haze. Luke, skeptical and angsty, mocks the old attractions, but his true yearning emerges as a distant uncle recounts family tales at midnight on warm summer nights, haunted by artificial bondings masked within the glow of sleeper pods.

One evening, need erodes resistance, prompting all four succumb to a synchronous breakdown—driven by the chronic trappings nullifying wholeness. They push through layers of psychedelic visuals programmed to immerse fidgety slumberers, navigating a conscious revolt against perfect sleep curated by adaptive AI. The inertia calls upon forced connections, unveiling the back discipline packed beneath binge intentionally orchestrated in blankets and padding reminiscent of each individual's past. By tapping into profound shared vulnerability that stirred rusty echoes between warm laughter and reluctant tears, their collective will surfaces against dinner-round-conditioned emotions markedly inherent yet unexplored since optimizing strawberries incrementally calcifies identities into mediocrity sicklings.
