In the year 2045, society has radically transformed with the advent of Sleep Synthesis Technology (SST). Nighttime rest no longer consists merely of retreating to bed; instead, individuals upload their consciousness to immersive dream environments that cater to their deepest desires and fears. This skilled manipulation of sleep and wakefulness is controlled through the Hub, a central neural network accessible outside a Small Home Unit, where most people live with their families. The story follows Ava, a mother longing for a connection with her daughter, Zara, who often spends her nights lost in fantastical dream worlds. Their lives intertwine with Finn, Zara’s childhood friend, who begins to struggle with unfathomable experiences that become too terrifying to control, and Clara, an empathy-based AI tasked with assisting in hormone regulation, guiding individuals through sleep using personalized data synthesis.

Conflict arises as Ava anxiously observes Zara retreating deep into dream realms, making less time for the living world. Ignoring her mother's voice, Zara spends nights crafting an alternate life where she is a gallant warrior. Finn, who deals with increasing nightmares during recurring SST sessions, finds himself inexplicably trapped. These nightly treks into Zara’s world hilariously blur the lines between fantasy and reality, and unbeknownst to Zara, they can overlap dangerously — signaling subconscious manifestations that threaten the body awake. When Finn decides to uncover the hidden dangers of their “Nights of Adventure”, his mission draws Ava into a last-minute effort to guide Zara through a dream rescue mission, hoping to demonstrate the fleeting value of reality. Clara offers assistance to all three, tapping her knowledge and honing techniques to assist in managing their collective dream energy.

During their journey through a dazzling series of dream layers, they find themselves challenged by both their aspirations and latent fears. As they work collectively to traverse fantastical terrains vividly reflective of each character’s burdens and imbued lessons about ownership of one’s intentions, a shocking gate incapacitates all progress, revealing ominous presentations intertwined with risk. To gain successful passage through this forgotten void, they each face their greatest phantasm: Zara confronts her buried distress regarding her mother's emotional alienation, Ava wrestles with reconciling with a nurturing dilemma in a landscape ruled by withdrawn ideations, Finn must learn how to embrace vulnerability while granting others agency in narration. They unite, pushing through the physical barriers posed by psychic nightmares, realizing their convictions bloom stronger together.

The truth revealing the monstrous weight of truth encounters judgment time plays at twilight, where alter realities intersect idly. Just as the travelers hope to see the fog of night lift, tragedy strikes, commanding them into conflicting realities as Finn suffers the effects of consistently hovering in untamed subconscious cubicles. As Zara overhears Ava wishing fruitful sightseeing moments would manifest once more, realizations burst, jubilation overshadowing when courage spills intelligently rippling trust within relationships barely birthed from stale facades.
