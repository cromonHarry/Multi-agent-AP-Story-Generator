In the year 2042, the concept of “Bedtime” has transformed into a highly regulated ritual governed by advanced technology. In this world, where sleep is no longer a solitary sanctuary for individuals but a communal experience fueled by neural connectivity, citizens rely on “slumber pods” — AI-driven devices that help synchronize their minds to achieve optimal rest. Protagonist Lila Morgan, a nervous ten-year-old girl, struggles with this new sleeping arrangement, haunted by her fears of not conforming to the social sleep patterns mandated by society. Unlike her precocious peers, who embrace bedtime enhancements with enthusiasm, Lila craves the natural ebb of timeless sleep. With her protective but tech-obsessed mother, Ji-Hoon, worried about Lila's deviance, and her pragmatic older brother, Oliver, stuck between loyalty to family and acceptance of progress, the family's bedtime routine often becomes a battle of technology versus instinct.

The tensions in the Morgan household escalate as educational pressures mount; children are being evaluated on their sleep patterns and efficiency. School officials measure dream retention to determine aptitude levels, and those with 'underslept' metrics face social ostracism. One evening, spurred on by whispers of an underground group called “The Awoken,” focused on returning to natural sleep, Lila defies her parents’ strict protocols and sneaks out searching for a rebellion against the slumber pods she despises. Though filled with trepidation, she brings with her the rebellion’s mission for natural rest, driven by her restless soul and vivid inclination for an unfiltered and genuine night of dreams. Lila, befriending the charismatic Patrick, leader of The Awoken, begins to learn about the joys of unabashedly exploring human existence without technological confines.

As exhilaration crescendos with each passing day, the awakening draws unwanted attention. Ji-Hoon discovers that Lila has abandoned her pod, deeming the insurrection dangerous and leading to file charges against Patrick’s emerging underground. The heated conflict reaches its height during SummerSleep, a mandatory national event designed to showcase the maximum efficiency of this engineered slumber lifestyle. During the exhibition, all students are plugged to designated slumber pods, intently monitored as they are meant to dream synergistically, yet the tension within Lila clashes starkly. Falling prey to her hidden struggles, she rebels against conformity.

Lila’s protest reaches its footer when she fiercely advocates for the authenticity of dreaming, disrupting SummerSleep broadcasts with unfiltered videos chronicling her unsanctioned/protégé approach. Thousands of students witness her restlessness as she encourages youths stuck in conformity to sip recovery via emotional expose rather than genteel-gloved suppression. Following the chaos, the slumber pods fail to function as expected, revealing systemic software flaws that appall parental society. Meanwhile, the onlookers resonate with Lila’s designed tampering, prompting fears about health and reclamation embroiled by technology-profit motivations. In discord, freedom comes alive through languorous recollection of mishaps against systematic cycles.
