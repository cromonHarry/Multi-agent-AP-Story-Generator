In the year 2045, the world has transformed the concept of "Bedtime" into a high-tech ritual governed by neuro-augmentation and programmable dreams. Society has embraced a neural interface known as the Dreamweaver, a device implanted in the brain, allowing individuals to customize their dreams as easily as choosing a playlist. The spark of human imagination now shimmers even in slumber; children and adults alike virtually escape countless times over, trading stories someday that turn into data mining exhaust for commercial interests. Within this brave new world, Mia, a struggling pediatrician, is burdened by the issue of failing to connect with her young patients as they drift off into synthetic fantasies, while Lemoine—an ambitious Dreamweaver engineer—seeks innovations to exploit these fantasies commercially. Together, they navigate the moral entanglements shaping their lives and those of their spherical encounters each night. 

As schedules surpass the ability for natural sleep rituals, anxiety leads many to a phase called "Neuro-Nightmare Reckoning," leaving addiction and insincerity maladies. Mia grows concerned about the fallout, noticing young Andre, an 8-year-old boy clinging to the fringes of nightmarish turbulence, fearing what his nighttime uploads might bring. Driven to save the innocence lost in superficial programming, she enlists her skeptical neighbor Kyra, a journalist in search of explosive narratives, and Unai, an elderly dream that acts altruistically outside of the parameters imposed by money-focused journalism. Gathering a following as well as risk-averse society behind powerful people switch on their devices too, the four embark upon a course to find the lost "pause button"–a forgotten piece of technology that allows genuine dreaming without corporate unwillingness interfering with boyish innocence.

In a covert, dark underground facility dictating the Dreamweaver world headquarters, the quartet uncovers forty years of suppressed technological archives and medical journals left from wanton amalgamations. As they dig deeper one stark truth emerges—real dreams provide the brain an armored boat floating on secretly bundled ideals of creativity and vulnerability. Ideas about joy begin bubbling in the oncoming cacophony of wiped imprints, as venture frustration emerges in wanting pathways stifled; chaos igniting strangling horrors inside heartbeats turning beat — registering infinite tributaries factor-ing layered shattering souls forever sung.
