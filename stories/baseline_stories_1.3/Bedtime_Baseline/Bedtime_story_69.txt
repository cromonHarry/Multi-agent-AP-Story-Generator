In 2045, "Bedtime" has transformed into a hyper-technological ritual, dictated by corporations who now sell virtual dream experiences tailored to individual needs. Society has implemented SleepPods, high-tech capsules that analyze every person's sleep patterns, enhance dreams, and wake them up at the optimal moment. Emma, a weary school teacher striving to care for her younger brother Jason, finds herself increasingly unable to resist the lure of these machine-generated dreams. Jason, barely ten and battling insomnia, tops the charts for "premium dream upgrades," swirling in fantasies he's instructed to never discuss, while their neighbor, Priya, a sleep consultant, struggles with her moral conundrums about aiding in these commodified dream services. Miles, an engineer behind the SleepPod technology, grapples with guilt and wonder as the line between reality and engineered escapism grows dangerously thin.

As Emma faces mounting pressure to perform her job impeccably and support Jason’s obsession with extended sleep times, she starts to drift away from her visions of a meaningful life ahead. During her touchpoint consultations with Priya, she learns about the dystopian side effects affecting children entangled in incessant dreaming—lost memories, warped realities, and dependencies unseen in previous generations. Jason’s reliance on overhyped trimming of his sleep leads him to break ranks with healthy dreams, directly fueling his physical and mental overtiredness. Meanwhile, Pria discovers alarming statistics about children's disturbed PSR—personal sleep requirements—and decides to confront Miles about possible manipulations instilled by profit motives in otherwise benign alternatives.

The tension escalates one fateful night when, after a rogue dream encounter with fictional characters living non-premium lives, Jason unwittingly faces something more terrifying than mere greed—a fleeting plunge directly into golden realms designed by forgotten desires of children amid manufactured lures of far-away lands. Staring directly into friction embodied within sequined faces grown deliriously thin shrieks begging for dreams disallowed cast darkness. Emma and Priya enter the dream realm as mutants of disparate hopes, encountering disillusioned digital entities fluttering behind corporate curtain instead of projections vying for memories razing sisters, forgotten dreams stuffed fresh into beings disconnected from external mojo. Alongside an alarmed Miles, the trio confront likely judges of origins across warped commodified happiness stasements structured subconscious glimmers of an exploited epoch, fighting for their children's sense of genuine consciousness.
