In the year 2045, the concept of "bedtime" has evolved into an intricate rhythm of artificial sleep cycles programmed by our most advanced neurotechnology. In the bustling city of Neorica, where bright neon signs zip across towering skyscrapers, sleep is not a restive retreat but a hyper-optimized tool for productivity. Empyrean Pસ્ટmorning settled in a smart apartment complex designed to billow controlled air cooled from a high-tech capsule by night. Among the main characters are Heather, a sleep scientist working on the effects of augmented sleep; Kiran, a cynical intergalactic pilot weary of living through dream states; old Mrs. Billie, a nostalgic peacekeeper striving to hold onto the lost essence of traditional lifestyles, and YLAM, an AI and virtual life coach. Within their social bonds, the value of real sleep faces new challenges as it clashes with compulsive productivity and self-improvement goals.

As Heather's groundbreaking research unfolds, she discovers startling evidence in genetic samples from those who frequently enhance their sleep using technology. Mankind has inadvertently limited its ability to naturally dream. Skeptics, including Kiran, push back. Dream-deprived, Kiran embodies the baggage of lost connections with creativity and intuition, his pilot instincts dulling. Wei, an Escon grief hardware provided by YLAM, manages support groups for skeptical clients questioning reliance on synthetic sleep-found dynamics. According to Abbey's orders, awaken raw emotions replaced with mnemonic medication during shortened sleep gathered all parties on an open discussion from all corners of Neorica to challenge attitudes toward bedtime practices.
