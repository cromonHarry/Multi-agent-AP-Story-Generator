In the year 2045, the world as we know it has become intricately tied to technology. Society revolves around an advanced Sleep Nexus technology, where sleep chambers enable individuals to experience idealized dream sequences. The illusion of bezpieczeństwo or personal safe dreams has revolutionized how people approach sleep and bedtime. Orla, a devoted researcher of the Sleep Nexus, is working on dissecting its psychological effects. Her estranged brother, Jesse, exists on the fringes of this society, living in an underground community that has rejected the sleep technology outright, wary of the vast corporate interests backing it. Arabella, a high-ranking executive in Sleep Nexus, grapples with growing unrest among her company’s users, leading sweet dreams into unsettling territory. Alongside her, Tachyon, an AI designed to enhance dream design, learns emotions through exposure to distressing incidents in the lives bumping against illusory peace.

Orla receives news that Jesse has been caught and incapacitated by suppliers disconnected from the Sleep Nexus — people oriented toward a primal reality, unhindered by dream manipulation. As tensions escalate over citizen over-reliance on simulated experiences, Jesse envisions rekindling a painful bond with his inscrutable sister whom he holds accountable for abandoning their family honor in pursuit of fabricated slumber. Determined to understand the impulsive myth that conventional dreaming curses its users to sleep for oblivion, Orla seeks Jesse to recall the raw, spontaneous memories swaddled inside their childhood. Meanwhile, Arabella organizes conferences to acknowledge increasing complaints about parasomnia (sleepwalking induced by the tech) among users too briefed upon narrative-dependency within environments tired by stagnant scripts.

Confronted by a corporate coup aiming to saccharize those speaking against Sleep Nexus, the stage is set for a rebellious clash. At a prominent launch event for the latest iteration — which claimed to inspire actual experiential themes for user-synchronized communication — a shocking glitch moment awakens all attendees to the omnipresent snooze state of emptiness they live inside. Within the chaos, Jesse, brazen and heart-jaded, stealthily gear up with local allies believing each experience adds insight essential for developing genuine retorts. Orla, yearning to separate her family history from her spotlighted career, mirrors centrifugal innovation with old activations by securing Tachyon to strive for randomly inspired experiences unreasoned by consumers’ requests. Personal clashes swirl in an evolving show of strife where competing projections might unveil profound truths lying clandestinely beneath layers.
