In the year 2085, society has radically transformed the concept of "Bedtime." With the introduction of NeuroRest technology, humans can erase day-to-day fatigue and instead engage in sleep "sessioning," where optimized dream environments are curated by artificial intelligence. In Eris City, Dean Cole, a sleep engineer; Lena Saito, an aspiring dreamscape artist; Harold Ogden, an old-fashioned novelist; and Tessa Herald, a sleep-policy activist, each navigate this brave new world differently. Dean is focused on creating immersive dream simulations for clients, hoping to captivate their imaginations through fleeting experiences. Lena strives to push the boundaries of what dreams can look like, drafting fantastical landscapes designed to inspire. In contrast, Harold realizes that the romance of nighttime and dreams—personally raw aspects of existence—are dying, compelling him to draft one last novel about traditional sleep. Tessa resists the growing socio-economic reliance on NeuroRest, believing it threatens authentic human relationships and experiences.

As NeuroRest gains more traction, RapidFly, the company behind the technology, dramatically influences how individuals interact with sleep. As Dean unveils his latest AI-curated dream, its deep immersion astounds the public. Pursuing her passions, Lena encapsulates her masterwork, a vivid, dream-filled escape called "Shatterrealm." However, friction starts shaping their worlds as Harold publishes an article critiquing the technology, proclaiming it a zombie-fication of cultural heritage trivializing genuine human emotion and storytelling. Tessa, meanwhile, pushes for reforms, hopeful to re-envision sleep as a communal experience, advocating that emptiness—electronic naps and forgettable reverie—erodes meaningful human connections. A heated discussion arises at the next town hall meeting as Tessa and Harold challenge Dean and Lena, igniting a deep philosophical battle over dreams and relations revolved around neuro-injected sleep sessions.

The climax unfolds during a live public demonstration at the weeklong "Real Sleep Fair" balanced between NeuroRest’s dazzling stunts displaying Dean’s and Lena’s innovative leaps. Amid experimental Reborrow utilizing verbal memoir memories tied to dreams, an unexpected technical failure leaves dream-customers experiencing lucid realities—unfiltered recollections of disconnection and pain from lives they've packaged away or destroyed. Stripped of the comforting facade built by technology, community members converge around experiences forgotten in vicarious dreaming just as families can alter memories digitally or ask each other conscientiously what empowerment means—real convocation conspiring together. Suddenly, Nina's specially designed work-of-art dream decompresses, thrown into external nightlife’s trappings; dreams ripple between optimism weaving love inside friendships experiencing leaning back.
