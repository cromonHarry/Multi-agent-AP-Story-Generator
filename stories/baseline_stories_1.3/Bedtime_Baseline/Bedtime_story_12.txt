In the year 2045, society has undergone a seismic shift in the concept of "Bedtime." With advancements in technology and neuroscience, sleep is no longer a cherished, nightly ritual but instead a regulated program administered through ear implants. Night Cycle, a corporate entity, has capitalized on this innovation, promising restored health and improved productivity through their Sleep Sync Systems. Despite the heavy emphasis on efficiency, four friends—Celia, a tech-savvy journalist; Marco, a weary cop skeptical of surveillance; Jenna, an aspiring artist seeking authenticity; and Raj, a data analyst attached to Night Cycle’s program—struggle to understand the consequences of this commodification of sleep.

As nights grow shorter and days overflow with urgency, the friends begin to notice alarming changes around them. Celebrities ascend into the media's limelight as “Sleep Champions,” individuals praised for conforming entirely to the chemical drips administered during their programmed slumber. Crimes proliferate, fueled by insomnia in those resistant to the system. Marco befriends Juanel, an ex-robotics engineer, who thumbs his thumb at the irrationality of sensation-free “rest." Getting dragged deeper into this world unbeknownst to the group, Raj justifies the program to Celia, but she clings to the vivid dreams climbing unbidden from her past. After a tense debate ignites, Celia prompts them to face the unknown side of the well-rested facade—a dormant resistance of “Free Dreamers,” shadowy groups attempting to bring back authentic experience through nightly excursions away from technology.

Gifted with hidden navigational tech, Celia persuades Marco and Raj to accompany her on a nighttime mission to locate the Free Dreamers. Taken deep into the city’s underground, their purpose soon dims as over-exhausted soldiers clad in sci-fi disguises capture Jenna for bombarding the dreams they learned to treasure, seizures claiming hold as Electro-Insomniac surfaces. A colossal riot emerges across the domain of Night Cycle to rattle against mechanized sleep quotas as extended hours now sedate them collective dreams. Aligned realization envelopes them—freedom moving softly towards a shaken routine burst fueled by rebellion. 

Inside the chaos, the trembling engineers extract one vital fight: rendezvous to seize stored unobstructed zones verdant-blue; within that volatility lies fear, stamina cursing its holding. The network is rhythmically wagered, jamming hallway marks. Marco and Raj brave the altercations, tearing crooked limbs towards love of authenticity, as Celia geeks over war paths appearing around dim corners, mapping genomic blurs between fear and synergy. Distanced phalanxes embedding glazed-eye strangers reverberate with excitement buoyically, while awakening stretches spark from permission-less memory sculpted undream aside safeguarded uncharted teams excising malaise.
