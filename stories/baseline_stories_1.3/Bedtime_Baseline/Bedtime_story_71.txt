In the year 2045, society has evolved far beyond the simple duality of day and night, as people now abide by the Circadian Dreams Program (CDP). Sponsored by the colossal tech corporation, SelenTec, the nightly ritual of sleeping has transformed into a meticulously engineered communal experience powered by neuro-interface technology. Unbeknownst to the general populace, the true intention of CDP isn’t merely better sleep; it's data mining through dreams, puppeteering the subconscious of its users via the Sleeping Loft—huge pod-like structures situated throughout urban centers. Ollie, a cognitive dreamworker who crafts themes and narratives for sleep, accidentally stumbles upon blurred digital footprints of corrupted code that had exchanged authentic dream sequences for manipulated fantasies designed to influence behavior and consumerism. Fueled by curiosity, he shares this discovery with Imara, an anti-tech activist; Jay, Ollie’s skeptical roommate; and Lisa, a rogue coder who shares Ollie's disdain for corporate oppression.

One fateful evening, Ollie encourages his friends to experience a demo of the latest sleep technology together at the local SelenTec hub—a shift token celebration entitled Communal Dreamwave. As the team goes through the event's sensorial preparations, Ollie's instincts voice caution—he believes the expedited popularity will mask a far sinister agenda. Voluntarily testing dream versions of each other's diurnal memories, they open a window to lucid intertwinings of thoughts, depicting echoes of what they truly desire. Strikingly, Imara unearths a projection of jarring visuals deeply rooted in trauma and frustrations regarding authority. In her atopick shadow of idealism, the betrayal sends ripples across joy to despair; it would soon define their unnecessary vacancy in exposing forced conformity.

While navigating the neural pathways in this electric ethereality, a monolithic terror alters--Click--accidental activation echos as a direct backlash dawns across connections in sleep structure. Ollie witnesses systemic suggestions reeling backup wellspring Dread; flawed dream allocations decade-roll into physiological chaos. Their saboteur dream state catalyzes echoflux signals broadcasted across the connected pods while triggering vertigo and distortion in the Sleeping Loft atmosphere. Realization strikes solid：the corrupt coding morphs night terrors threatening to hard-lurch their cognitions entirely.
