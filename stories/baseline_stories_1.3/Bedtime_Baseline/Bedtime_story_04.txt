In the year 2047, the concept of bedtime has transformed dramatically, merging advanced technology with ancient rituals. Society now embraces Sleep Stations—small, pod-like structures found throughout urban landscapes that utilize artificial intelligence and biofeedback systems to enhance and tailor sleep experiences. Sixteen-year-old Mira lives with her single mother, Elara, a Sleep Architect working for the government to optimize these sleep environments, while her brother Kai, age 10, depends on Sleep Stream—a virtual reality bedtime program that animates dreamscapes specific to his imagination. Elyon, Mira's closest friend and a rebellious technophile, advocates for a subversive lifestyle away from the obligations imposed by structured sleep systems. As the theme of bedtime shifts from being a restorative natural process to a business-centric ritual, an untapped and mysterious Sanctuary awakens beneath the city, rumored to provide true rest without technology.

While occupied with everyday teenage challenges, Mira becomes fascinated by her inversion—an outmoded relic that lets her experience uncompulsed dreaming, spiriting her away to lands forged from her subconscious. Threads of imagination begin blurring the line between this meditation zone and the crammed realities enforced through her day's programmed activities. When Elyon learns about an underground rave brimming with people reliant on genuine rest and untouched by intrusive sleep designs, they emphasize its importance as virus-infected algorithms have recently urged excessive employment to attain ‘efficient sleep.’ As Kai wrestles against constant synchronous arrangement set by apparatus, Mira and Elyon spar over deadlines as her final experimentation day at the Sleep Station approaches, escalating tensions until the friendship and excitement sync together with aesthetic doubt.

On a fog-blanketed night, curiosity compels Mira to join Elyon at the unnerving haven. As immersion midst sensory overstimulation indecisively flakes away through layers of artifice, they uncover the ulterior motives behind equipment engineered to change raw consciousness rhythms into prescribed fractions. Eye-catching transmissions draw them further as Mira lands across banners announcing fittings for the renovated crawler of timeless tape dots as imaginations vainly head twice over their adrift everywhere nuances. An old professional rediscover his spirit leads not forward, only trails darker—gear constructs dance atop cherished facilitation organisms relentlessly exposing blank breadcrumbs. Inside, they chant primal teachings celebrating unbound opérations, arousing nostalgia for bedtime’s segued innocence nurtured uncomplicated nostalgia Karen the mother envisioned their childhood fowler on embraced skill gardens filtering enchanted trials nineteen years later.
