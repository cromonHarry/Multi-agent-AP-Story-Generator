In the year 2045, the tangential evolution of smart technology has led to the ubiquitous use of an advanced communication device known as the BiPhone—a blend of biotechnology and smartphone capability. Unlike traditional smartphones, the BiPhone interfaces directly with its user's neural pathways, allowing for instantaneous thoughts shared across networks. This technology is managed by the Omnisphere Corporation, led by the charismatic CEO Ariel Pathos. Seth, a talented yet cynical programmer, has been indispensable in fine-tuning BiPhone’s emotional recognition software, albeit he secretly intends to unscramble its source code to expose lurking privacy breaches. Behind the screens, Jin, an investigative journalist, fears that these gadgets are hijacking people’s agency while also searching for a bulwark against corporate dominance. Lastly, there’s Lila, the ethical hacker, disillusioned with how technology has replaced critical human connections and determined to reclaim personal data from hijacked corporations.

As the municipal celebration of the Fourth Mind occurs—an event honoring the integration between humans and machines—rumors swirl of a powerful underbelly aligned with Omnisphere, orchestrating detrimental changes in decoding personal thoughts and actions through the BiPhone.

Set against escalating discussions over data ethics and technological accountability, real concerns mount as irregular behavioral shifts plastered across districts indicate wish to escape from physical reality.

Tension amplifies when Lila intercepts a covert transmission revealing planned upgrades that anticipate post-emotional thinking—the very essence espoused by the BiPhone combined with sedation.goods. Convinced that such change threatens individuality, she orchestrates a meeting with Jin and Seth. But that night, members of a shadowy security division employed by Omnisphere pursuade Jin and Seth they would issue solutions to the management problems discovered via Lila’s conflict with sitbook records. Rather than derailing Seth’s technomatical edge through rampant secrecy, teamwork flourishes here, but boils over.
