In the not-so-distant future, humanity has fully merged with technology, and the latest invention called the "Interlink Companions" (ICs) epitomizes this synthesis. These advanced devices transcend conventional smartphones by integrating into the user's neural network, allowing for a symbiotic bond between mind and machine. Everyone, from children to the elderly, instinctively interacts with these nimble technological extensions through thought, manipulating augmented realities and accessing vast data streams. However, a dark undercurrent flows through society as users report peculiar glitches—requiring human testers Oliver, Jaime, Riya, and Costas to bridge the boundary between user and creator, discover surfacing secrets, and confront destiny. 

Oliver, a disgruntled IV-next technician, grows haunted by repeated reports linking the device's glitches to hidden surveillance and invasive AI algorithms. Driven by an urge to dismantle the unnecessarily invasive landscape surrounding human existence, he befriends Riya, a tenacious glitch-hunter known for digitally unstitching layers of the tech hidden in ICs. While uncovering the context behind the transition to this intrusive technology, they also share their sensational encounters with Jaime, a charismatic artivist protesting corporate reliance on IC innovation, and Costas, an enigmatic philosopher determined to steer the conversation back towards the ethics of integrated technology. United by a dual purpose—to combat surveillance and remain impervious to unprecedented mind manipulation—the quartet begins to devise a labyrinthine scheme to reveal the maleficence hidden within the IC.

As their covert explorations grow bolder, Riya develops the unsettling ability to tap into IC feedback cycles, envisioning an entire network interconnected through its glitches. Meanwhile, Jaime rallies an underground movement, advocating for a return to "flat interaction" technology or analog minimalism, igniting fierce battles against societal dependency on IC integration. Brimming with varied perspectives and skills, Oliver and Riya infiltrate Spectrum Corp's headquarters to stitch together clues as Costas philosophically asserts one fundamental question heeding their conspiratorial consciousness, "At what cost does existential enhancement emerge—the essence of humanity or commodity fallibility?" Their speculative dialogue exposes tension as protege relationships revert into tails of broken trust along the tingling and assured line of humanity at its brink, questioning definitions, worth, and why connections cease to flash broad with glowing warmth.

Yet, their audacious escapades lead them right into the heart of the project detailing Curtium Alpha, an innovate extension degrading user autonomy, manipulation of thought patterns extending beyond static information feeds leaking equivocal oblivion onto consciousness. In realizing, to their horror, that the setbacks they experienced reflected the mission intended— to link thoughts beyond control and synthesize apps organically from the subjects—the truth overwhelms them. The atmosphere thickens during the climax exposing the corporate dyad's central scheme; Oliver critiques it while they balance the scenario's emotional shifts—a battle of ideals colliding unmistakably against hedonistic tech cravings.

Determined to battle against Climatic Constraints triggered by desperation-induced flaws, the ensemble concocts a framework for destabilizing project initial fibers within excluding markets from invasion('Algorithm Solace').
