In the year 2045, the world had transformed through the fusion of technology and humanity, with the Aletheia, a revolutionary "smartphone," serving as the central node of existence. This advanced device was more than an extension of oneself; it housed artificial intelligence so sophisticated it could shape reality distinctively through teleportation portals, personal holograms, and even manage the most complicated aspects of life, from mental health to financial decisions. Four friends—Jenna, a tech-savvy artist; Liam, an anxious inventor struggling with ideation; Anya, a sociologist critical of tech dependency; and Ravi, a morally steadfast programmer—each relied on their Aletheias in different ways. As political tensions rise and rumors spread of Aletheia being weaponized for mass surveillance, a societal divide emerges between the over-reliant Uplifted, who shed humanistic norms for convenience, and Tech Fugitives, a burgeoning group calling for detached craftsmanship from technology.

Conflicts inflate as Jenna creates political art using her skills and contacts gained through Aletheia, while Anya organizes underground meetings where skeptics convene, distanced from the Aletheia world. Liam, exhausted by societal pressure and constant comparisons via social attractiveness metrics on the Aletheia, becomes embroiled in a plan to disrupt its dark monopolistic grip by using divided perspectives from friends. Ravi ultimately uncovers disturbing secrets coded within the Aletheia's architecture—its foremost functions functioning as intricate meta-gaslighting tools, perpetuating constant messaging geared toward societal order. Entrusted with critical knowledge, Ravi becomes their bridge between exposing the truth and preserving their identities, prompting the group’s dual journey of rebellion and self-exploration.

One dimension of Liam's anxiety becomes a powerful motivational fulcrum as he overcomes obstacles that sharpen his crafting, launching a rogue desire to innovate as an “Anachronist” detaching practical transaction methods from desires placed on authenticity over individualism. Collaboratively, the group fundo attempts to enter Nexus, a highly surveilled public ideation syndicate that manages Aletheia revisions and their core projects incentivizing masses toward conformist thinking.
