In the year 2045, society has fully integrated the next generation of smartphones into everyday life, now called "Neurophones." These devices interface with the brain using a neural lace, allowing users to project holo-images, interact with augmented environments, and communicate telepathically. However, with technology moving too quickly to keep up with ethics, a darker side begins to emerge: data addiction, loss of privacy, and the exploitation of personal thoughts can lead to widespread societal confrontation. Our four protagonists—Mira, a brilliant but tortured data ethicist; Thom, an empathetic tech blogger seeking truth; Jun, a software developer who created the original Neurophone, now dealing with monstrous side effects; and Greer, a mysterious act-activist revolutionizing digital freedom—forge unlikely alliances as they confront these pervasive innovations.

Mira uncovers a clandestine subplot buried within the latest Neurophone upgrade where users' thought data is being weaponized and sold to corporate interests. She uncovers this after discovering that her best friend's relationship has collapsed under the weight of unconscious revealments and intrusive marketing. Venturing into the underground network, she encounters Greer, a fierce advocate for personal data liberation. Drawn together by their common goal to expose the harrowing consequences of surveillance technology, they realize they must gather intel from Thom, the tech blogger with trusted followership. Before their plan could turn apocalyptic, Thom agrees to help investigate, unaware of the dangerous implications as power-hungry corporations swarm like predators.

Stimulating public discourse eventually leads Mira and Thom to confront Jun, an industry veteran turned fugitive. Jun exits the shadows during an exclusive media interview where he discloses risks that anguish consumers; every life-detail refined and patriarchally-parasitic Calibri processing on brain-links incurs deadly consequences. Paranoia festers as Jun's former corporate world dogs him relentlessly, retaining ownership over symptomatic souls disabled by inevitable dependencies.
