In the year 2042, smartphones have transcended their original purpose, evolving into fully integrated neural interfaces known as “NeuroConnects." These devices embed seamlessly into the users' neurons, allowing direct communication with the digital world. People, financially tethered to their NeuroConnects, establish identities entirely mediated by synthetic personalities and curated digital lives. Our four protagonists—Maya, a disgraced journalist haunted by her once-celebrated investigative skills; Elias, a reclusive hacker and whistleblower amidst rising government oppression; Juniper, a charismatic influencer with a façade hiding an edgier personality longing for authenticity; and Cobra, a rogue algorithms designer longing for true consciousness, find themselves navigating a world where reality and manufactured existence clash dangerously.

One fateful day, unexplained phenomena begin occurring on NeuroConnect networks: spoon-fed information shows bizarre discrepancies, users experience intense hallucinations, and many report losing time as their devices forcibly integrate their consciousness. Unbeknownst to them, Cobra, fearing dangerous outsourcements to his software French beyond recognition, has implanted a virus in the core design of NeuroConnects. The virus has tane curated portions of reality and morphed or removed seemingly harmless information at once, throwing society into chaos. As Maya investigates connections between the government policies tightening control over the digital citizens and complaints filtering in through nefarious Cerebrate Inc. channels, she learns from Elias that the feed adulterations follow the symbols of an anonymous hacker group. Uniting against forces they feel are straining society upon liberty revealed by monstrosities crafted inhabiting poorly secured minds, together the disparate group's bond strengthens as they encode further understanding together.

Traveling through black markets to liberate users and gather intel from hacking shadows, the group's dreamy rebellion catapults them into greater visibility and heated backlash as information reaching definitive members of high-power environments frightens leaders into a fury amidst the unrest thus unfolded.
