In the year 2045, the world had become utterly reliant on the Focal, the advanced evolution of the smartphone, which now embedded itself into neural architecture. Statements and commands were purchased on an open market, enhancing individuals’ cognitive capabilities in real-time. The four protagonists, Alia, a neuroengineering expert; Jonah, a revolutionary hacker; Miko, a digital rights activist; and birdlike AI drones Misu and Pik, formed a close circle. Against the backdrop of technological marvel, societal segregation intensified along the lines of access and virtual elitism. Millionaires linked physical indulgence directly with their Focal capabilities, while the underprivileged struggled with lagging versions of outdated software. 

Miko uncovers evidence of a horrifying practice among the privileged elite known as Neural Arbitrage, where the wealthy bid on neural dominance traits to possess atypical skills, leaving the rich smarter and the poor dumbed down. The troubling contrasts push Miko to rally support for her campaign to ensure equitable access to Focal technology, prompting Alia to leverage her knowledge and modify the Focal's algorithms. Meanwhile, Jonah, driven by revenge against the corporate executives who undertaken non-consensual testing on the Focal’s beta subjects—including the disappearance of his sister decreases realization of social equity, navigates his dual life within the underground’s hidden fiber-nets hoping for misuse amassed by the elite. Together, they embark on a mission that blurs lines between the sanctity of advancement and exploitation.

As tensions heighten, the group unravels the dark transportation network bringing together rich brains and underdeveloped minds that drive the shocking disparities at the bequest of massive crowd harvest by inept organizations.
