In the year 2045, grocery shopping has transitioned into a fully immersive experience thanks to advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Neela, a technophile grocery guide, leads customers through the sprawling HyperMart: a mega-house geared towards enriching the grocery shopping experience. Shaz, her pragmatic partner, specializes in product quality assurance, ensuring that everything offered is healthy and sustainably sourced. Leona, the gruff store manager, focuses on maintaining order, while Arthur, an elderly server robot with a surprisingly endearing vibe, caters to patrons’ queries, predicting their needs through complex neural analyses of purchase patterns. Amid the lush AR projections of vegetables, fruits, and processed goodies, grocery shopping is not just a task but a vibrant art of navigation meant to engage people at each step.

Just as they carve their niche in the high-tech market, events take a turn when rumors begin to surface about the HyperMart’s data being misused. Neela discovers through whispers from concerned mothers that social media is rife with mothers alleging their children displayed erratic behaviors after consuming certain promoted snacks retrofitted with industry-hijacked nanotech. Not convinced at first, Shaz eventually finds evidence of inconsistent ingredient sourcing and chemical additives. Torn between potentially harming consumers and loyalty to their job, they debate bringing their discovery to the limelight, wary of Leona’s uncompromising attitude towards company ethics, taking precautions not to endanger their positions.

Upon gathering the courage to confront Leona, things spiral out of control when she insists strengthening the grocery’s customer loyalty programs—retaliating with legal actions against Neela and Shaz for doubting product authenticity. Building tension finds Shaz digging deeper, working after hours with Arthur to hack the HyperMart systems while seeking clandestine archives within the grocery tech. Yet, things escalate rapidly when perverted algorithms attached to genetic-engineering products reveal that HyperMart manipulates AI, locking subtle inferential traps to influence shoppers’ minds, grazing morality and ethics to spin an uncontestable profit cycle for reflexively dying **guardians of good** at no fault but for innovation by nefarious design at the hands of commercial avarice.
