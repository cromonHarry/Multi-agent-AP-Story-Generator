In the year 2042, society has undergone a technological and sociocultural shift that redefined how people acquire their daily nourishment. Autonomous drones zip through the sky delivering groceries directly to consumers, while healthy, lab-grown food pulsates on scaffolds in urban districts. In this thriving metropolis, Lila Carlson is a bioengineer with a passion for pioneering synthetic foods that actually taste like the original. Her husband, Max, is a tech-savvy hacker who maintains the robust infrastructure of the grocery delivery systems. Their neighbor, Sam Martinez, runs a once popular local grocery store transformed now into a community hub focusing on education about sustainable eating. Lastly, young Zeke, Lila and Max's son, represents the future generation hopelessly torn between digital convenience and the fond memories of ‘real’ food that consists of endless home-cooked meals.

Amidst this era of convenience, social media chatter erupts when a scattering of drone deliveries fail catastrophically, including pilfered products and a peculiar groan-inducing sound emitting from extra-trader software that integrates augmented reality for personalized shopping experiences. The food that landed in various homes becomes a topic of debate; consumers rally behind retro food fairs, showcasing handmade dishes in contrast to health-savant-planned packaged goods. Lila is both conflicted and inspired by the discontent of her community about the grocery-less nature of living, sparking her curiosity to experiment with live food without preservatives. Meanwhile, Max finds himself at the epicenter of a growing underground movement comprised of tech-savvy pranksters who seek to spur chaos in the looming systems.

As the festival-celebrated nostalgia of home-cooked meals expands, a confirmatory Flashtalk invitation begins scrolling across every screen promoting "Prosper-Store", a looming 4D grocery experience that promises to replicate meals shaped by consumer customers’ most understated desires. Eager to pursue his objectives, flying under Max’s radar, Zeke embarks to invent a virtual currency transaction for exchanging real flagged recipes from his favorite apps, tying cooking talent with sustainable farming in the hope of offering the neighborhood something unprecedented. Unbeknownst to them, Prosper-Store holds covert intentions—aiming to weaponize nutrient RNA encoding in their products, respectively using the foods’ manipulative potential as modern day pheromones to enlist consumers as compulsory customers of corporate chains.
