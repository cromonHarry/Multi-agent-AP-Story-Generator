In the year 2045, the global food system has undergone a stark transformation. Urban MegaFurniture Inc. has integrated AI-driven vertical farms into their grocery outlets, now 100% self-sustainable ecosystems blending groceries with breathtaking square-foot murals displaying ever-changing local art. Citizens rely on smart carts, equipped with holographic interfaces, capable of predicting dietary needs and alt-text substitutes based on genetic health analytics gathered via wearable tech. Caleb, a disillusioned health consultant, our protagonist, is repulsed by the concept of "intelligent meals" composed of synthesized ingredients designed to meet nutritional quotas, rather than personal taste. Fast asleep in his cubicle at Lifeguard Mental Health Services, his close friend Ava, an ambitious data engineer, dreams of revolutionizing food production with exciting new algae-derived proteins. Meanwhile, Marco—a mart employee turned amateur radical—secretly seizes the opportunity to rewrite grocery transparency laws, while their enigmatic supervisor, Dr. Reynolds, keeps ominous tabs on increasing health discrepancies.

As a community-leader-type meeting erupts for stakeholder insights into consumer wellness claims adapplied by the store, Caleb champions a dark path ahead, warning the group of suppressed health data due to algorithm adjustments. Ava strides in with solid data demanding a re-prioritized user experience emphasizing human agency reconnecting them with food. As tensions rise, customer vigilance bursts forth in unruly social media posts, outlining how harmful added preservatives concealing ingredient labels wreak havoc on immune defense systems of MegaFurniture, weighing heavily on those same suburban gut genetics monitored by each smart cart. Realizing the algorithm audiences would yield a lifestyle enshrined in confusion, Caleb and Ava find unforeseen solidarity while awakening automated workflows creating manipulated zoning fragrance blends which induce disturbing taste skews in children.
