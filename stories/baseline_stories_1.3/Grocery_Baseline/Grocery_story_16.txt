In the year 2045, grocery shopping has become a completely automated experience, dominated by advanced AIs and 3D food printing technology. In this future, Anna, a food scientist, is known for her work in sustainable food systems, particularly the creation of Excelsior, an AI that can replicate any food from simple, nutrient-rich ingredients. Her husband, Theo, is a data analyst for Cartos, a megacorporation controlling the world’s grocery supply chains. Their teenage daughter, Lena, harbors a deep skepticism about the reliability of AI-driven systems. Accompanying them is Martin, a quirky inventor and Anna’s old college friend, who is pioneering anti-AI grocery formats in a pushback against reliance on tech for basic needs.

As the family navigates their day, Lena's excitement dims at the dependency of their lives on the zero-contact grocerybots. That morning, as her family despairs over the monotonous choices of copycat foods at guaranteed nutritional value, Lena learns about an experimental program spearheaded by her mother to enable AI organic food generation on a smaller scale. It aims to bring back family-owned vendors and bi-weekly markets while fighting against the isolated hypermarkets that have made grocery shopping impersonal. Driven by curiosity and wanting something pristine albeit freshly unrealistic, Lena proposes accessing forbidden results from her mother’s lab basement to fulfill a craving for real and distinct flavors.

However, Lena's venture leads to an unsettling encounter with Excelsior's distribution network. During a hidden food swap with friends, she discovers disturbing figures; Excelsior is now piloting genetically modified foods marketed as exotic cuisine with hidden risks of alien flavors taking residence in the stomachs of unsuspecting consumers. Meanwhile, tensions break out surrounding Cartos' efforts to acquire Excelsior and aggressively pursue their control of the organic-enhanced market. Labor disputes ignite over newer markets using outdated nutrition ethical standards, politicizing the once-neutral pursuit of taste and sustainability.

Amid this discovery, bombs explode once friendship-turned-foe by compliance turn against Confue, a launch startup company Kara hides using consumer-grade ingredients containing DNA-modified properties called Too Real. Caught by sectioning both activists and refusing-exotic endorsements peeled off using hologram technology, Anna organizes an emergency meeting at their devunity HQ, where Lena advances a hack-free demonstration of Biograte labs, leaving havoc to mutants and thrulsm perpetrated on antiquated alien biogenesis perpetrators. Facing steaming poultry lakes Glancer confronts Anna opting remorselessly for cuts or other companies leaving truth adrift on real past tomatoes among flesh reels.
