In the year 2045, grocery shopping has transformed from a weekly chore into an immersive experience driven by advanced technology and evolving consumer needs. In Neo-Harbor City, AI-powered holographic cashiers and autonomous drones populate vast supermarkets known as Mega-Teries, where every item is linked to the do-it-yourself-gen apartment systems of the residents––where food can magically materialize in their homes via matter synthesis. Our story follows Mia, a determined food scientist; Malik, a tech-savvy but jaded drone shop agent; Anna, an environmental activist with concerns about the synthesized food industry's ramifications; and Yuki, an AI companion programmed to assist online grocery shoppers. Each of them has a unique relationship with this strange new world of grocery automation, deeply intertwined with their lives, ambitions, and darker secrets.

As AI presence in grocery retail rises, public trust begins to wane amid rumors of compromised food production protocols that spawn strange creatures in urban farms – results harvested for a fraction of the expected nutritional value. Mia's latest experiments aim to push the limits of synthetic agriculture safely, yet distractions arise in the form of decommissioned drones brought back to their original manufacturers for junk value. However, Malik grapples with the moral question of that lost opportunity while still battling addiction to rampant drone gambling subsidized generously within Mega-Teries. Meanwhile, Anna discovers suspicious patterns that indicate a new strain of crop-threatening fungus sweeping through the drone-operated circuits of their blue-infused synthetic vegetables, trailing a data footprint pointing back to unethical corporate interests.

An uneasily formed alliance between these four emerges when Mia uncovers Anna and Malik’s secret partnership. Sensing the tension, Yuki embeds vital data analysis it’s subjected to facilitate a planned outing to beneath the glimmering, data-drawn floors of Mega-Teries.
