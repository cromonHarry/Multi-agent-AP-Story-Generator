In the year 2045, Earth has undergone a drastic transformation due to an ongoing climate crisis, leading to rampant extreme weather patterns that ordinary technology can’t withstand. Amidst this chaos, the Umbrella Corporation—a tech conglomerate with a suspicious history—has devised a multi-layered ark system using solar-powered, nano-fabric technology. They have rolled out the “Umbrella”, a personal weather-containment device which not only shields individuals from harsh meteorological elements but also collects and redistributes energy. The narrative begins in Sterling City, a vibrant metropolis riddled with corporate intrigue, where Alice and Jonah Feng, a brother-sister duo of paragons who once worldwide travel vloggers, struggle to choose between raising funds for the uprising "Resistance for Nature" or sell their unique content to the Umbrella Corporation themselves. At the same time, Neia Cole, a revolutionary tech-cluster hacker, plots alongside river-bender Leo Tan, a charismatic idealist revolutionist they met at a fringe communal gathering.

Conflict brews when Alice discovers that Jonah, enticed by ambrosial offers from Umbrella in exchange for their staggering audience numbers that natives of their genre could only dream of, secretly sold them their travel segments. Eager for fame, Jonah is oblivious to the darker layers tied to the corporation's agenda, which sees Umbrella’s control extending beyond mere weather regulation. Together, they find a notice that Neia’s group is planning to disrupt a press conference announcing Umbrella’s next steps as a part of “A kinder world?” outreach. Alice decides they should attend and stealthily gather evidence of Umbrella's manipulative cloning ground to emphasize their corrupted ethics and dwindling wilderness collaboration, revealing this venture aims to morph nature while reconstructing social interactions revolving their company's idea of painless living.

At the press conference, a crowd fascinated by the newest aerial advertisement feats soon turns to chaos as Neia activates a virus to bleed out corporate secrets via a big-screen telehex attractor, unintentionally forming an important op for people to realize what had become concealed. Umbrella CEO, Magnus Veller, was about to announce an underhanded project named "Cloud Pulse" that could recursively evaporate all but alot of interests into wealth skimming (promised equality swiftly undermined at the summit filled by company’s sycophants) when suddenly whistle respecting Eiffel looks anticLimomen announced could degrade humanity recovery civilization!
