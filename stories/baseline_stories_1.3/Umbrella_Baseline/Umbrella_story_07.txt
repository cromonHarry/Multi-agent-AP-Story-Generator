In a near-future metropolitan society called Neo-Stratum, climate engineering has become the norm, and the weather is tightly controlled with a global technology known as "Umbrella." Initially developed to combat extreme weather events, the Umbrella project matured into a network of massive satellites releasing pollutants and maintaining artificial weather patterns. Valentina, a spirited environmental scientist with deep skepticism toward Umbrella, works for one of the corporations enforcing this weather control. Noah, her longtime friend and a technician at the Umbrella maintenance and monitoring center, is excited about his role in the program while downplaying the consequences of interference with nature. A grade-software hacker named Kix, disillusioned with Umbrella’s corporate transparency, aims to expose its detrimental effects. Lastly, there’s Ravi, a charismatic activist advocating for the dismantling of the Umbrella system altogether, rallying people to create alternative sustainable communes outside of controlled zones.

As Valentina grows increasingly concerned about the adverse effects on both the environment and human health attributable to the Umbrella project, she begins her private investigation. She finds code within a software update capable of intensifying moisture retention, stealthily depressurizing weather depressions to harness sponsorship fees from companies relying on predictable droughts or rains. Annoyed at Noah's blind faith in technology, she organizes secretive meetings to rally disillusioned colleagues, including a hesitant Kix drawn in by her courage. Kix, conflicted between his digital rebellion instincts and some loyalty toward his own corporate ties, decides to infiltrate the Umbrella mainframe. However, when Kix unexpectedly gives accurate intel about a colossal scheduled Umbrella maneuver involving hundreds of commercial satellites, the gravity of the manipulation becomes apparent to all.

On the eve of the maneuver known as the Great Release, tension peaks when Valentina proposed delaying it to educate key policymakers. Ravi rallying support, plans a protest at the headquarters, risking a full-blown exposure of Umbrella’s true objectives. Meanwhile, Noah’s bubble bursts as he unearths indisputable evidence via Kix: the additional moisture is not merely controlling weather but using water as leverage against agrarian regions and impoverished communities. Veering between loyalty and protection of his friends, he realizes placing corporate accuracy above human lives indicates systemic failure. The day of the Great Release witnesses checkpoints set by both activists and the undercover police, predicting violent confrontation between parties involved.

When the drone enforcers utilized by Umbrella detect escalating riots, they escalate into a centralized siege. Trapped amidst the sparks, Valentina proposes circumventing earth boundaries via commandeered signals infiltrating the command structure that runs the satellite system. She, Kix, and Noah allied for real-time reshaping of the scheduled moisture, pledging instead to disperse raindrops over affected agricultural areas in parallel with Tammy’s guerilla grassroots demonstration. Up against shielded headquarters monitoring from facility perimeters waged tightly, day collapses at the expense of most recent moon spoiling glances of remnants lost.
