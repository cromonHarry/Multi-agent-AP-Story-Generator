In the year 2045, the world has transformed into a digital matrix suspended beneath a perpetual dome called the Umbrella, a colossal artificial structure that shields civilization from the increasingly unstable climate outside. It was developed by the tech conglomerate Novix to protect urban dwellers from the ravages of storms, radiation, and the shifting elements of an irreversibly altered Earth. Dayna Harlow, a brilliant but disillusioned climate scientist, struggles with the irony of her invention being used not to heal the planet but to maintain a superficial façade of normalcy among those who live under its protective shell. Living alongside her are Finn Graves, a rebellious teenage hacker, who seeks to expose the truth about the dilapidating state of earth’s surface; Marco Kincaid, a veteran politician who champions Novix's agenda for control; and Neva Villows, a visionary engineer secretly working on an upgrade for the Umbrella that could not only sustain but revive the biodegrading energies of the fading Earth.

As persistent glitches in the Umbrella’s algorithm widen the divide between public illusion and reality, Dayna grows acutely aware of an overarching deception that masks a dying environment. Both consternated and fascinated, Finn devises a plan to hack into the mainframe governing the Umbrella’s systems, while Reverend Durin lema smiles through each billboard-decorated event hosted by Kincaid praising the state of prosperity beneath the synthetic dome. Dayna reluctantly champions Finn and Neva’s cause, unearthing evidence that reveals Novix secretly replicates and sells patches of fabricated earth to the affluent while letting the impoverished wither away in backstreet towns suffering from systematic under-resourcing. Trusting her new allies, Dayna is pushed to leverage her own standing in Novix to fight against exposing the company’s imperative. The urgent threat that looms beyond the tentacles of the manufactured comfort entangles newfound urgency to remind the public that the land can be saved, but only by recognizing what lurks outside.

As tension mounts, Dayna accompanies Finn and Neva through labyrinthine network modules underneath the Umbrella, racing against Kincaid’s surveillance operators who tighten control as infighting ignites within Novix. With hacking access and improvised technology, they aim to redistribute medical resources to those noticeably left behind. At the same time, the stakes grow dangerously high as outspoken demonstrators unleash reveals online, causing a ripple effect among those complacent souls sheltered beneath the facade of their civilization. The trio of unlikely acolytes escalates their rebellion by enacting radical performance art in the city squares—all leading to a monumental show of strength planned for the Umbrella’s apex where their hacked video feed would prompt individuals akin to tentacles expanded outward toward the truth’s reaping blossoming generation running free surfaces to ventilate souls foreboding.
