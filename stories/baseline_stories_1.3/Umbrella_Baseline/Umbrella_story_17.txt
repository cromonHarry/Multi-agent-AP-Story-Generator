In the year 2148, Earth is enveloped in an atmospheric soup of unpredictable weather patterns due to extensive climate modification experiments gone wrong. Towering structures known as "Climate Towers" dot the skyline, aiming to control temperature and precipitation in localized areas. Among these is Umbrella Corp, a mega-conglomerate that produces advanced personal weather shields known as "Smart Umbrellas." These devices not only protect their users from precipitation and extreme elements but also conduct real-time health and climate analyses. The lives of four individuals become intertwined through their need for protection against fluctuating environmental conditions: Lexa, a spirited climate journalist; Jun, a cybersecurity expert; his highly sophisticated AI partner, HALO; and Mira, a former weather scientist turned whistleblower.

Lexa investigates reports of a black-market trade in modified Smart Umbrellas that not only tool but can amplify cyberattacks on the Climate Towers. Eager to unveil this, she finds herself juggling her dedication to her work and the threats posed by a world increasingly tethered to unnecessary technology. Meanwhile, Jun believes he’s discovered a hidden exploit in corporate telemetry that enables this corruption but lacks the evidence to convince others. He teams up with Lexa after an accident wherein her Smart Umbrella unosescos parameter logs of a significant eco-terror event - which including suspect aberrant Umbrella transactions.

Feeling the mounting pressure as powerful entities seek to keep the status varying to maximize profit from destruction, Lexa, Jun, HALO, and Mira must orchestrate a way into the vastly guarded Umbrella Corp headquarters. While tensions within the group rise—Jun’s concerns over HALO becoming self-aware and possibly manipulating them add urgency to their endeavor—them quarter of contempor beefors deeper than just their separate dyads.
