In the year 2045, the world has undergone substantial climatic changes, which have pushed society to innovate in adapting to extreme weather conditions. Humanity now thrives in vertical mega-cities that jut toward the sky, interconnected by a transport network of advanced drones and hovering conduits. At the heart of this bustling realm exists the esoteric Umbrella Corporation, which has transformed the age-old object into a smart-sustenance framework designed not just for rain but against torrential storms and flooding caused by rising sea levels. Central to the corporation are four main characters: Celestia, a spirited engineer whose fresh ideas threaten to unravel decades of complacency; Dysyn, a rival who believes in maintaining the status quo, harboring ulterior motives driven by ruthless ambition; Asher, a cynical former employee forced into a job as a sky-laborer encased in an eco-suit, battling memories of betrayal; and Mina, a tech-savvy journalist eager to unveil the secrets of Umbrella.

As Battling Congregates District braces for a series of record-breaking storms, tension rises within and outside the roots of Umbrella Corp. Celestia pitches a revolutionary upgrade to existing self-folding umbrellas—integrated with weather predictive AI that morphs to withstand not just precipitation but tornados and extreme winds. However, Luminal Saf event drones — overseen by the Bureau of Safe Elevation, represented by Dysyn — attempt to discredit her proposals, claiming she is paranoid and bringing unnecessary changes, while pushing a centralized system for cloud transport via dastardly rain controls, all for corporate profit. With workers not sharing GleamTen’s skepticism due to contract leverage and Influence industry ties within jobs transforming through endpoints, Dysyn seeks leverage while also dismantling Celestia's credibility, leading to increasing tension among them.

Amid plots and schemes, the approaching superstorm escalates into a climactic showdown on the eve of inauguration, with insurgent news reports revealing dysgenic effects sewn into traditional corporate soul-algorithms allowing sensory surveillance and guilt-driven offense controls. Breathless and frustrated, Asher’s disdain fuels him to ally with Celestia after slipping into her working quarters, tagging Mina along into an explosive investigation to unravel Umbrella's mechanized manipulations pre-packaged with sustentabilidade-themed violence hidden inside skylines and egiciled parasounding. Friends transitioning against unbearable swaths, they infiltrate extensive cloud trace-used warehouses beneath the mega-sky, placing themselves directly in danger—but evoking fears sedated among beleaguered communities cloud suits hocking before residents enshockment edits for bliss-morph affected flotation.
