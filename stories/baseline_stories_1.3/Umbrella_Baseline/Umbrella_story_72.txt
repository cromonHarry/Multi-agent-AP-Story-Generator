In the year 2045, society has become heavily reliant on technology for survival, after climate changes have wreaked havoc on the planet. The Umbrella Corporation, previously a medical technology firm, has successfully transformed its operations to dominate global protection technologies. Their latest invention, the Sentient Umbrella, encapsulates IME (Intelligent Médio-Environment) capabilities, serving as both a companion and personal shield that adapts to environmental hazards. Skye, an environmental activist in her late twenties, secretly leads The Umbrella Group, a community dedicated to breaking free from corporate control; alongside her are Marcus, a rogue engineer who helped design the Sentient Umbrella, Elara, a hacker with a talent for uncovering urban secrets, and Jasper, a young journalist seeking to expose corporate malfeasance.

Skye's growing disenchantment with Umbrella’s manipulative tactics intensifies when her father falls ill due to an environmental disaster that could have been mitigated. Fueled by their controversial campaign, The Umbrella Group employs complex software that simulates Umbrella products' surveillance behavior. As they unearth critical evidence revealing chemical emissions tied to Umbrella’s development facility, the team realizes their project is turning criminal after their code breaches over a million database security protocols. To avoid stopping cold, they conduct a massive publicity campaign right from Skye's errant rooftop amidst raging storms, using drones and projection guerilla tech to uncover their findings live to the world.

As protests rise, the stakes increase. Can voyeuristic visuals expose the enormous moral divide between humans who are plugged into their persistent digital experiences, tethered to Mr. Adams, the gritty response leader at Umbrella Corporation, and the growing body of irate citizens unwilling to bow? Unbeknownst to them, Peters, the primary software deter in their plan, is feeding insights back into Umbrella via unexpected backdoors. Ultimately, automated FAQ drones descend in swathes threatening environmental rebellion activists with termination policies as they spread incriminating plausibilities of sabotage as origins for chemical spillage coupled with hearing warnings ration competition against Skye's desperation to formally out-prove her father’s connection to current events left to ashes.
