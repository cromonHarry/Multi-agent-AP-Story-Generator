In the year 2045, the landscape of Earth has been transformed by climate chaos and a tech revolution, where personal safety during severe weather conditions has reached catastrophic levels. Urban hubs are shrouded in perpetual storms, and the sun has become a luxury most cannot afford, turning the outdoors into an arena of unpredictable, sometimes lethal, weather. Amidst this turmoil exists an elite company known as UmbrellaON, innovating smart “umbrellas” that integrate AI technology to not only shield users from the elements but also regulate their environments through atmospheric manipulation. Four childhood friends — Jina, an ambitious engineer; Malik, a cautious climate analyst; Aria, a prodigy in both art and design; and Kai, an inspirational activist — reunite at their ten-year high school anniversary amidst these problems. They share fond memories of carefree days that have strangely vanished in the new world dominated by the omnipresent corporate shadow of UmbrellaON.

As the group reconnects, Jina’s dazzlement about her work at UmbrellaON soon shifts to doubt when Malik explains his development of data showing the company's experiments on the populace. The umbrellas, it turns out, control the ozone levels in prescribed areas, creating artificial weather nice enough to benefit UmbrellaON’s stakeholders among the wealthier classes while ignoring the damages it deals to those outside these zones. Propelled by a sense of urgency, the friends decide to investigate UmbrellaON under the cover of night. With Aria’s aptitude for stealth architecture and Kai’s fervor for activism, they devise a plan to infiltrate the company’s headquarters and retrieve data that might prove the malevolent contribution of the "umbrellas" to climate oscillations and displacement of communities.

The group’s diabolical journey culminates in a high-stakes heist as they navigate state-of-the-art security not just with skill and determination but with rising tension and internal disagreement about how far to go. When they reach the central data access room, they discover that in truth, UmbrellaON is suppressing important weather forecasts to ensure profitability. The climax of their infiltration occurs as Jina becomes torn between her loyalty to the sharp intelligence federation she built years in the hotcake of innovation and unsettling evidence of its recklessness they’re unearthing. Tensions hit a fever market – friendship balances on a fulcrum as donors approach.

However, agents sent by UmbrellaON descend upon them when an alarm is triggered by Malik, impulsively attempting to download the incriminating information. During the chaotic script-fighting indoor-downpour sabre thrown by thrown-out psycho protocol storm drones darting even-out apartments beyond their newssubmit systems, camaraderie leads Patrick and Aria to sacrifice their safety for Malik and Jina to escape.
