As tensions rise in New Avelyn, a corporate conglomerate announces its plan to centralize flavor technology, threatening the culinary community's diverse identities. Lyra organizes an emergency meeting at the Culinary Council, urging her peers to draft a manifesto for flavor equity, emphasizing the importance of cultural narratives.
