As Ivy Ryner prepares for a groundbreaking live performance meant to fuse personal stories with cultural heritage, she discovers a significant backlash from Lia Sommers, who argues that Ivy's work risks erasing traditional narratives. Meanwhile, Theo Elridge faces a crisis when his new biometric AI malfunctions during a test run, triggering conflicting emotions in the participants and leaving them overwhelmed. In the chaos, Jasper Kade sees an opportunity to facilitate a global virtual dinner, where chefs from various cultures address the tensions.
