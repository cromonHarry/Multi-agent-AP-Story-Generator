At the height of the potluck, as the community gathers in a vibrant display of food cultures, tensions erupt when city officials arrive with a stark ultimatum: the impending infrastructure changes will decimate the vertical farms, yielding control to corporate agriculture entities. Lumis' heart pounds as she sees the fear on her neighbors' faces, feeling the weight of her mission. Fueled by passion, she steps to the forefront, calling on Owen and Maya to speak out. Zeki's augmented reality projection becomes a catalyst, depicting the community's flourishing biosphere, igniting a rallying cry for unity. Together, they confront the officials, asserting the right to their food sovereignty, drawing a line in the sand against the encroaching corporatism that threatens their very way of life.

In the aftermath of the potluck confrontation, the community rallies around Lumi's call to action, launching a grassroots campaign that amplifies their fight for food sovereignty.
