In the year 2147, a society dazzled by cognitive interfaces struggles with the dissonance of hyper-connectivity. Lia Hawke, a visionary architect of Cognitive Sanctuaries, tirelessly constructs havens for those weary of the perpetual mental hum, hoping to rekindle their sense of self.

Lia and Juno lead the charge, orchestrating a visual symphony of non-verbal expression, while Orin performs an impassioned monologue that echoes through the crowd, passionately defending the core values of the 'Silent Minds' movement.
