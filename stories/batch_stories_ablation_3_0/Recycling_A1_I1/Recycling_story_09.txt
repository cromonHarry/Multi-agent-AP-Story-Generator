As Nora curates her ambitious community art project, aiming to transform waste into an immersive experience that reflects the community's collective identity, tensions arise. Eli struggles to ensure that the diverse voices of the community are genuinely represented in eco-governance discussions, feeling pressure from factions that resist change.
