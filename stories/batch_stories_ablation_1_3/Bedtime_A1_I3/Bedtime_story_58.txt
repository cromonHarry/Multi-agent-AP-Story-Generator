In the year 2147, as the neon skyline of Elysium pulsates with energy, residents prepare for the sacred ritual of sleep, their lives woven into a tapestry defined by shared dreams.

Meanwhile, High Facilitator Orion Gale struggles to navigate bureaucratic tensions, feeling the weight of history as the quest for societal harmony unfolds amidst inescapable sleep inequalities.

As the Global Sleep Summit approaches, tensions between the Dream Governance Networks and advocacy groups reach a boiling point. Lyra Henshaw presents an ambitious project aimed at creating a unified dream space to counteract sleep inequality, but skepticism looms as Jules Vann challenges its feasibility without broad access to the technology.

Jules Vann and Lyra Henshaw unite their voices, igniting a passionate call for immediate reform, emphasizing that dreams are not just for the privileged but a collective right. Dr. Seraphine Quill, witnessing the emotional impact, confronts Orion Gale, demanding that they bridge the divide between the privileged and disenfranchised through their work at the Dream Governance Networks. The atmosphere crackles with tension as the summit becomes a surreal experiential battleground, where communal fears and the unspoken need for empathy echo across the vast psychic landscape, challenging the very foundation of their society and igniting a fierce hunger for change.
