Meanwhile, Rachel Kwan's neural sculptures challenge the communal narrative, inspiring critical discourse on lost identities. In the shadows, Eliot Chen ignites quiet dissent, yearning for the reclamation of personal thought in an intensely interconnected world. As their paths intersect, questions of individual authenticity spark a profound dialogue on the ethics of shared consciousness.
