Meanwhile, Juno captures the unfolding chaos with her art, embedding biometric poems within the graffiti walls of Neo-Geneva.

The stage is set for confrontation, where each character’s true allegiance will be tested in the battle for authenticity.

As the Biometric Fair descends into chaos, the air crackles with tension as Ayla leads a ferocious march into the heart of the gathering, brandishing her identity manifesto—an emotionally-charged digital art piece broadcast through Juno's cultural nanobots.

Miles, caught in the storm of rebellion, recognizes the gravity of his choices, stepping forward to offer redemption by enabling the decentralized networks to dismantle the oppressive market. This pivotal moment intertwines protest and art, igniting a collective consciousness that challenges the very foundations of their biometric society.

In the aftermath of the tumultuous Biometric Fair, Neo-Geneva stands in a wake of transformation.
