As the 'Dental Values' movement continues to gain momentum, Lara Voss faces backlash from traditionalists who fear that the reliance on AI and nanotechnology undermines the artistry of dentistry. Momentum shifts when Remy Jones organizes a large-scale online challenge promoting collective oral hygiene, inadvertently exposing stark disparities in access to AI-driven dental care technologies across socio-economic lines.

Remy harnesses social media to mobilize public support, urging citizens to share experiences to foster empathy and drive change. As Dr. Keane proposes an immediate audit of AI systems to rectify inequities, the group stands united, intent on transforming the crisis into an opportunity for advancing 'Dental Rights' and restoring harmony amongst all citizens.

Following their collective decision to address the crisis, Lara Voss spearheads an audit of the AI dental systems, rallying community volunteers to assist in data analysis.
