In the year 2045, smartphones have evolved into intricate neural interfaces known as "NeuroLinks." These devices, seamlessly integrated into the user’s biology, allow for thought-based communication, augmented reality experiences, and instant access to vast databases of knowledge. 17-year-old Mia, a tech-savvy prodigy, has developed a knack for hacking NeuroLinks to explore their hidden functions. Her best friend, Ethan, is more skeptical, wary of their potential dangers. The duo often explores abandoned sectors of the once-thriving city, searching for remnants of the old world and rumors of a mysterious underground group called “The Disconnect,” who reject NeuroLink technology. Meanwhile, Mia's older brother, Jason, a NeuroLink programmer, navigates corporate interests, hoping to enhance the technology while battling his own ethical dilemmas over its impact on society.

As Mia and Ethan delve deeper into the abandoned sectors, they uncover a cache of pre-NeuroLink smartphones. Intrigued by the simplicity and nostalgia of the older devices, they begin experimenting with them. When they accidentally tap into an old database, they receive cryptic messages hinting at The Disconnect’s location. Tempted by the allure of meeting others who share their doubts about NeuroLink, Mia convinces Ethan to seek out the group. Along the way, they encounter Sarah, a brilliant coder disenfranchised by mainstream society. Sarah distrusts the NeuroLink’s pervasive control and is drawn to Mia’s rebellious spirit. Together, they discover a dark truth: NeuroLinks can manipulate human memories, altering perceptions and molding identities according to corporate interests.

The trio finally locates The Disconnect's hidden headquarters, a fortress-like complex filled with individuals who have rejected NeuroLink technology. They learn that Jason has also been investigating, trying to prevent a corporate takeover of The Disconnect’s philosophies. At a massive rally, tensions rise as supporters of NeuroLink clash against the rebels, and amidst the chaos, Mia recognizes Jason in the crowd. Distraught and feeling the societal weight of their opposing beliefs, she fights her way through, desperate to reach her brother. This leads to a confrontation where Jason reveals the damaging truths behind NeuroLinks: memory alteration, addiction to the technology, and the erasure of genuine human connection.

As the rally culminates in violence, Mia makes a daring decision to hack into the NeuroLink central network from within The Disconnect. In a race against time, she creates a public broadcast revealing the manipulations behind NeuroLink technology, exposing the corporations to the world. The chaotic scene falters as the truth spreads, forcing many to confront their dependency on the technology. Amidst the ensuing fallout, Ethan supports Mia, encouraging their group to embrace a balance between technology and reality, advocating for choices in how they interact with the world.

In the aftermath, the world begins to rethink its reliance on NeuroLinks. Mia, Jason, Ethan, and Sarah come together to establish a new movement promoting digital literacy and personal agency, allowing individuals to choose how they engage with technology. The remnants of old smartphones become symbols of a more mindful approach to connectivity. As tensions ease and dialogue flourishes, Mia reflects on the bittersweet nature of progress, recognizing that while technology can connect, it also has the power to isolate. Together, they commit to shaping a future where humanity and technology coexist harmoniously, celebrating the power of choice and the importance of genuine connection.
