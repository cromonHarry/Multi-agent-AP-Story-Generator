In the year 2045, the city of New Haven stands as a beacon of technological progress, thriving under a domed atmosphere designed to filter pollutants and regulate climate. At the center of this urban utopia is the Umbrella Corporation, a giant tech firm that once manufactured traditional umbrellas for rain. Now, they produce advanced eco-dome technology known as "Umbrellas," personal atmospheric shields that can adjust to weather patterns, protect against UV rays, and filter air quality in real-time. The city’s inhabitants are dependent on these devices for survival, and they are virtually inseparable from their "Umbrellas." Among them are four friends: Juno, a spirited journalist; Malik, a brilliant but disillusioned engineer; Elena, an environmental activist; and Sam, a talented tech hacker. Each of them has a personal stake in uncovering the increasingly suspicious activities of the Umbrella Corporation, as residents begin to complain about strange side effects from prolonged use of their devices.

As Juno investigates, she discovers a hidden connection between Umbrella’s atmospheric technology and an increase in respiratory illnesses among citizens. At the same time, Malik, once a devoted employee of the company, uncovers evidence suggesting that the latest model of the Umbrella units contains a software update designed to siphon off users’ health data without consent, all packaged under the schism of privacy settings. Fueled by a sense of injustice, Elena urges her friends to take action, combining their skills to disclose the hidden information to the public. Meanwhile, Sam hacks into the Corporation’s database, finding something far more shocking—a government conspiracy involving Umbrella’s technology as a means to control the population and suppress dissent by manipulating the AI that governs the eco-dome itself.

The friends decide to meet at a secret underground venue known as The Haven, a rebel hideout populated with activists and those affected by the corporation's decisions. As they formulate a plan to expose the truth during the upcoming Global Utopia Conference, where Umbrella will showcase their latest innovations, they face mounting threats from the corporation's security personnel. Their resolve hardens, and they prepare to infiltrate the conference. On the day of the unveiling, Juno takes to the stage instead of the scheduled Umbrella CEO, brandishing a device Sam created to display their hacked footage. As she reveals the truth, the audience gasps—projected onto the massive screens are clips showcasing the devastating side effects of their beloved technology and the covert manipulation of their personal data.

The chaos that ensues is electric as attendees realize they’ve been betrayed. However, the Umbrella Corporation’s private security team quickly moves to silence them, leading to a dangerous confrontation. Malik, with his insider knowledge, directs the group through an escape route while Elena rallies the crowd, urging them to reclaim their autonomy. The friends manage to facilitate a mass reveal of the corporation's wrongdoing inside the conference before escaping into the city, where people are already beginning to rise against the oppressive grip of their tech-induced complacency. The truth spreads through social media like wildfire, turning into a grassroots movement that challenges the reality they’ve been fed by the corporation.

In the aftermath, the Umbrella Corporation faces legal battles and public outrage, leading to significant reforms in technology governance. Juno, Malik, Elena, and Sam become reluctant heroes, armed with experience and knowledge to educate others on the importance of transparency in technology. Their exploits inspire a larger movement advocating for ethical technology that respects individual rights and freedoms. As New Haven begins to reclaim its identity, the four friends look up at the real sky, unmarred by the artificial dome overhead. They gather their own newly designed, unbranded umbrellas—simple, sustainable, and free of corporate greed—symbolizing their commitment to forging a new path forward, one where technology is a tool for liberation, not control.
