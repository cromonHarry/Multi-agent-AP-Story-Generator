In the year 2045, the world has transformed into a sprawling metropolis powered by artificial intelligence and advanced technology. In this society, traditional cooking has become obsolete, as cuisine is managed by high-tech stovetops called Nutri-AIs—intelligent appliances that not only prepare meals but also adapt recipes based on individual dietary needs, mood, and even the health data harvested from wearable devices. From the gleaming spires of the cooking center where culinary masters once ruled, four friends—Maya, an aspiring chef, Lucas, a nutritionist, Elena, a tech-savvy programmer, and Raj, a skeptical food critic—are gathered in Maya’s small apartment, each with differing views on this evolution. While Maya is keen on showcasing her culinary talents, she finds herself trapped in the shadows of the Nutri-AI’s prowess. Meanwhile, Lucas emphasizes the importance of personalized nutrition for mental health, while Raj believes modern stoves have stripped away the artistry of cooking.

Motivated by a desire to reclaim the artistry of cooking, Maya decides to host an underground dinner party for their tight-knit community, where she will cook without the interference of technology. She enlists the help of Elena, who constructs a temporal stovetop—a retrofitted device that mimics cooking techniques from the pre-Nutri-AI era. This device not only reignites the art of cooking, but it also connects to the nostalgic, sensory experiences associated with food. As preparations unfold, the group faces conflicts: Lucas worries about the health implications of Maya's menu, which lacks the precision of nutrient tracking. At the same time, Raj remains skeptical about whether the dinner can truly satisfy a contemporary palate molded by advancements in culinary science.

On the night of the dinner, tensions run high. The four friends buzz with excitement and anxiety as they await their guests, a diverse group willing to venture back into the raw experience of cooking. As the dinner unfolds, aromas fill the air, and conversations flow alongside the bubbling pots. However, just as they sit down to indulge in the meal, an unexpected power outage plunges the building into darkness. The Nutri-AIs simulate panic in the connected building, urgently redirecting energy to thermoregulate the cooking devices, but they are thwarted by Maya's traditional approach. The friends must resolve whether to rely on the failing temp controls of the Nutri-AI or to trust their instincts and the connection formed by their shared experience.

The climax intensifies as they band together to navigate the chaos. With echoing kitchen sounds, laughter, and the smell of simmering ingredients, they face the irony of their love for technology clashing against their yearning for authenticity. Their shared struggles and creative solutions create a powerful connection among the attendees. After improvising brilliantly using their limited resources—Maya leading in coordination, Elena troubleshooting technology, Lucas advising on safe consumption, and Raj surprisingly enjoying the simplicity of home-cooked flavor—their meal is assembled just in time, meeting the guests’ diverse tastes and preferences.

As the electricity returns, the Nutri-AIs resume normal function, but the group finds themselves changed. Inspired by what they’ve created through teamwork and human ingenuity, they agree to host the "Reclaiming Stovetop" event monthly, melding both ingredients and ideas. Raj writes a heartfelt review celebrating the night’s experience rather than just the food, while Maya gains clarity on her path as a chef, vowing to integrate tech and tradition. As the quartet takes a moment to reflect, they realize that while progress is inevitable, the essence of cooking—creativity, connection, and cooperation—remains timeless, a flame that neither technology nor time can extinguish.
