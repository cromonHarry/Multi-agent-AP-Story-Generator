In the year 2045, cooking has transcended its traditional roots, with every home furnished not just with smart kitchens but specialized “Stovetop” devices capable of transforming energy into complex meals in minutes. The Stovetop has become a social hub, featuring holographic displays and AI companions that guide culinary adventures. Among the bustling community in Nuova Metro, four friends—Avery, a culinary engineer; Malik, a food historian; Tessa, an eco-activist; and Jonah, a tech-savvy entrepreneur—gather regularly to discuss the impact of technology on gastronomy. They share a vision of returning to the roots of cooking, finding meaning in the act itself amidst the automated convenience of their world.

As the friends dive deeper into their discussions, Malik uncovers an ancient recipe said to enhance strength and mental clarity, rumored to be lost for centuries but believed to be housed within a black-market library of forbidden cookbooks. Intrigued, they decide to embark on a quest to retrieve this recipe, all while grappling with their own beliefs about food and culture. Tessa argues against the commercialization of food and pushes for ingredients that are sustainable, prompting Malik to explore not just the recipe, but the story behind its ingredients. Meanwhile, Jonah envisions a new app leveraging AR technology to recreate this ancient dish, dreaming of revolutionizing how people connect with food. Avery strives to design a prototype Stovetop that can accurately replicate the traditional flavors while using eco-friendly ingredients.

Their journey begins as they gain access to the hidden library, faced with a gatekeeper hologram that sets a series of challenges tied to historical cooking techniques. Each friend must showcase their expertise: Malik provides historical context, Tessa identifies sustainable ingredients, Avery hacks the library’s safety systems, and Jonah navigates the tech puzzles to uncover the ancient recipe stored in a digital vault. When they finally decrypt the data, they realize the recipe requires a rare herb that has been extinct for decades, sending them on a frantic pursuit across Nuova Metro’s black market. As time slips away, their friendship is tested, revealing underlying tensions and differing views on progress versus tradition.

Just as tensions boil over, they reach the underground market and find the last known plant. However, they’re ambushed by a gang that sees the recipe as a means to exploit the entire city's pop-up food scene. In a climactic showdown, they combine their unique skills to fend off the gang, showcasing the bonds they’ve forged through their culinary adventure. They narrowly escape with the plant, realizing it symbolizes not just a recipe, but the importance of collaboration and conscious cooking in a world oversaturated with convenience.

In the aftermath, the group gathers around a makeshift outdoor stovetop, where they finally prepare the ancient dish using the rare herb and a blend of ethical, local ingredients. The experience is both cathartic and grounding, reminding them that cooking can be an art form even in an era of machines. Inspired by their journey, Jonah releases the app based on their adventure, but modifies it to encourage collaboration and ingredient foraging rather than commodification. As the sun sets over Nuova Metro, the friends solidify their commitment to using technology as a means to connect with food and each other, proving that even in a future ruled by automation, the spirit of cooking can still thrive.
