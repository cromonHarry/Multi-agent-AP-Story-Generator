In the year 2045, society has transformed "Bedtime" into a meticulously calculated algorithm that maximizes mental well-being and productivity. Sleep hygiene has morphed into a communal experience, with smart technology dictating optimal sleep cycles and ambient environments. The central character, Mia, a sleep consultant, grapples with her dedication to encouraging clients to adhere to this regime while secretly yearning for more personal and disconnected moments. Meanwhile, her childhood friend Jax, a rebellious hacker, explores the underground movement that advocates for organic sleep experiences, free from digital oversight. Beatrice, Mia’s aging grandmother, symbolizes pre-transhumanist ideals, often reminiscing about the simplicity of her bedtime stories. Lastly, there's Theo, the ER doctor who relies on sleep tech to cope with the demands of his job but harbors a secret struggle with insomnia that artificial solutions have failed to remedy.

The situation escalates when Mia discovers that a new government initiative, "SleepSync," promises to blend everyone’s sleep cycles into a communal frequency, purportedly to "enhance societal productivity." Concerned the program could erase individuality and freedom of choice, Mia reaches out to Jax, who invites her to a clandestine meeting of the "Unplugged," a group dedicated to reviving natural sleeping habits and pushing back against SleepSync. They devise a plan to disrupt the SleepSync implementation by exposing the dangers of technology that attempts to control something as personal as sleep, while Beatrice offers traditional methods of storytelling to help them reconnect with what bedtime used to mean.

As the launch of SleepSync approaches, tension mounts. Mia is torn between her job and her loyalty to her friends and family; Jax's plans grow more daring, aiming not just for disruption but to showcase the negative impacts of enforced communal psyche on personal health. He proposes a city-wide blackout during the SleepSync initiation, where members of the Unplugged will gather to share their personal bedtime stories, hoping to remind society of the human connections that bind them. However, their plan takes a darker turn when security measures become tighter, and they receive a warning that those opposing the initiative will face severe consequences.

On the night of the planned blackout, the city is suffused with a tense silence. As Jax and Mia navigate the streets, they find hidden pockets of people gathering for the event. Beatrice shares her story of courage and resilience, igniting a sense of nostalgia among listeners, including Theo, who has come to witness the rebellion. They dispel the fear of disruption, choosing instead to embrace the liberating experience of free, authentic sleep, away from the oppressive constraints of technology. As the crowd resonates with newfound energy, authorities attempt to intervene, yet the solidarity among the people becomes a loud declaration of individuality against the mechanical facade of bedtime.

In the aftermath, the SleepSync initiative falters under public scrutiny, forcing a reckoning within society about the intersections of well-being and technology. Mia, with newfound clarity, merges her consulting work with the Unplugged, advocating for healthier sleep practices that don’t conflict with personal choice. Jax becomes a local hero, teaching the importance of nighttime rituals that celebrate humanity instead of commodifying it. Beatrice finds solace in her storytelling, bridging generations and restoring trust in communal narratives. Theo, inspired by the stories shared, seeks alternative methods to manage his insomnia. Together, they cultivate a movement where "Bedtime" evolves once again, embracing the beauty of connection, authenticity, and the comforting return to simple rituals, reminding everyone that sleep, like dreams, should remain decidedly personal.
