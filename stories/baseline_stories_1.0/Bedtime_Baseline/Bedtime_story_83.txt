In the year 2147, the concept of "Bedtime" has been revolutionized through advances in technology and a societal shift toward the importance of mental health. People no longer require physical sleep; instead, they enter a state called "Cognisleep," a neural program that immerses them in vividly constructed dream environments tailored to their emotional needs. At the heart of this society are four individuals: Mira, a skilled Dream Architect who designs one-of-a-kind dreamscapes; Ethan, a skeptical Journalist investigating the potential dark side of Cognisleep; Lila, a young girl experiencing anxiety around the system because she often wakes up trapped in her dreams; and Max, Mira's boyfriend, who supports her craft but begins to question the ethics behind it as tension rises in their personal lives.

As Mira dives deeper into her work, new features of Cognisleep emerge, promising users ever more immersive experiences. However, she begins to notice a worrying pattern: the dreams designed for users are erasing their memories of the real world, blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. Meanwhile, Ethan's investigation leads him to underground forums where users share their disturbing experiences with Cognisleep, including Lila’s struggles with waking nightmares that amplify her fears instead of comforting her. Each character's journey begins to intertwine—their fates guiding them toward revelations that challenge the comforting technology society has come to rely on.

After intense debates and a series of troubling encounters, the plot reaches its climax during a demonstration of a new Cognisleep feature set to launch globally. Mira unveils a dream designed to draw out humanity's collective fears, helping them confront their anxieties. But while Lila is undergoing this experience, she finds herself locked in a perilous loop, unable to wake. In a twist of fate, Ethan witnesses Lila's struggle, and without understanding her complex experiences, he rushes to the technical control room, determined to shut down the system. Simultaneously, Max confronts Mira about the ethical implications of her creations, triggering an emotional showdown that forces her to weigh the impact of her innovations against the needs of people like Lila.

In the aftermath of the launch, with Lila still trapped, Mira and Ethan reconcile their differences and team up to find a way to navigate the world of dreams. They harness Max's connections in tech to create a patch that could save Lila, while also protecting others from getting trapped in their Cognisleep. Their determination blurs the lines of their personal lives as Mira must face the consequences of her artistic choices. The emotional weight of the story crescendos when they finally succeed in extracting Lila from her fears, leading to a cathartic moment that redefines their priorities in life and love.

The resolution sees the characters growing beyond their initial viewpoints. Mira modifies her dreamscape designs, ensuring they prioritize mental stability and memory retention. Lila becomes a face for the movement to use Cognisleep ethically, helping others learn to navigate their emotional challenges. Ethan publishes a comprehensive exposé, advocating for more transparency in the technology that previously seemed like a cure-all. The world starts to awaken from its dependence on escapism, promoting a healthier relationship with sleep, dreams, and reality. In a poignant final scene, Mira and Max hold Lila's hand as she drifts into a restorative, organic sleep, merging the line between technology and the intrinsic need for genuine rest.
