In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed dramatically. In a world where artificial intelligence governs daily life, sleep is no longer a natural necessity but a processed event overseen by the Sleep Management System (SMS). Children are programmed to follow sleep schedules optimized for their development, while adults engage in tailored sleep experiences through neural interfaces. The protagonist, Mia, a curious ten-year-old, lives with her parents: Ava, a sleep researcher who advocates for the latest technological advancements, and Ben, a nostalgic architect who longs for the simple routines of the past. Alongside her best friend, Leo, an imaginative boy who dreams of adventure, Mia begins to question the artificiality surrounding bedtime as she notices the emotional distance it creates between families.

One evening, as Mia prepares for her pre-programmed sleep session, she confronts her disillusionment. The bright holographic sleep pods flood their room with soft colors, designed to induce the perfect sleep cycle. As she lies in her pod, a clandestine chat with Leo reveals his own distress over the lack of genuine nighttime rituals, such as storytelling or stargazing. Fueled by their shared desire for authenticity, Mia and Leo hatch a plan to disrupt their scheduled sleep regimen. Meanwhile, Ava is determined to present her latest research on sleep enhancement at an upcoming conference, unaware of her daughter’s growing rebellion against the technological norm. The stage is set for a clash between the comforts of modernity and the tender yearning for tradition.

As night falls, Mia and Leo act on their plan, sabotaging their pods to venture into the luminescent city of Neotropolis. Armed with nothing but a flashlight and their imaginations, they discover an underground community of "the Dreamers"—those who have chosen to reject the uniformity of the SMS. Here, they engage in age-old bedtime traditions: sharing stories, singing songs, and even exploring old constellations. This blissful adventure, however, is interrupted by the arrival of the Compliance Unit, tasked with enforcing the city’s bedtime rules. The children realize that their carefree rebellion may have consequences, especially as their curious exploration juxtaposes their parents' rigid belief in the safety of the SMS.

In a tense moment, Mia and Leo must evade the Compliance Unit while rallying the other Dreamers to stand together. Their mission becomes a movement as they face not just the enforcers of technology, but their own families who arrive in pursuit. Ava and Ben discover the hidden lives of their children and their community. The climax builds as Mia, brimming with courage, confronts her mother with the truth: the connection they've lost in prioritizing productivity over genuine experience. The confrontation is intense, revealing deep-seated fears and values that neither side fully understand until now.

In the aftermath, a fragile truce emerges within Mia's family and the Dreamers. Ava recognizes the importance of blending tradition with innovation, proposing a new project that integrates family storytelling and connection in the SMS system. Ben, finally at peace with the merging of past and present, collaborates to design communal spaces allowing families to enjoy the best of both worlds. As the children return to their adjusted bedtime routines, they embark on their nightly journeys enriched by the magic of creativity and imagination, proving that even in a futuristic world dominated by technology, the heart’s yearning for connection remains timeless.
