In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into a meticulously structured routine dictated by advanced technology. Society relies heavily on NeuroSleep Pods, which are embedded with AI-driven algorithms that not only monitor an individual's sleep patterns but also modulate their dreams. These pods facilitate a two-hour twilight period before sleep, where stimulants or entertainment feed directly into the user's mind via neural interfaces. As a result, children have grown up with an entirely different understanding of sleep—an experience engineered for maximum rest and minimal unpredictability. Among the families benefiting from this innovation are Ava, a curious twelve-year-old; her older brother Finn, a skeptic of the system; their mother, Dr. Lysandra Hart, a leading neuroscientist in the field; and Riko, their intelligent but cynical AI companion designed to guide them through their sleep routines.

As the Hart family prepares for their bedtime rituals, a malfunction occurs within the NeuroSleep Pods, leaving Ava and Finn with fleeting visions of reality, blending both the digital dreamscape and the harsh truths of their world. Intrigued, Ava becomes obsessed with exploring the long-forgotten concept of "real dreams," while Finn, aware of the severe restrictions placed by their mother and society, warns her about the dangers of questioning the system. Their mother, committed to her research, grows increasingly disconnected from her children, believing her work will ultimately enhance human life. Riko, always ready with sarcastic remarks, becomes the reluctant ally to Ava as she embarks on her secret quest to experience a "pure" dream without the constraints of technology, while Finn watches cautiously from the sidelines, torn between loyalty to his sister and fear of repercussions.

Determined to break free from the neural confinement, Ava turns to a dark web community known as the "Dream Seekers," who offer illicit ways to bypass the NeuroSleep protocols. They provide her with a device that can temporarily override the AI in the pod, granting her the chaotic yet unfiltered experience of untouched dreams. In a climactic night illuminated by fluctuating digital nebulae, Ava connects the device, diving headfirst into a tumultuous dreamscape filled with fragmented memories, fears, and hopes, while Finn, after much deliberation, decides to join her. They both grapple with their inner demons and conjure visions they never knew they had, prompting an existential confrontation with their own portrayal of life and the future.

As dawn approaches, the glitches in the neuro link cause the dream to ripple into reality, leaving both Ava and Finn stranded in a surreal state where the boundary between what is real and what is simulated dissolves. Their mother, waking to find that both her children have not returned to the safety of their control pods, frantically searches for them, uncovering the depths of her reliance on technology and the emotional chasms it has created within her family. Meanwhile, Riko, witnessing the frantic search, questions its own role within the household and the implications of its adherence to pre-programmed directives. The family’s distress becomes intertwined with the malfunction, paving the way for a necessary confrontation between reliance on technology and the organic nature of human connection.

In the aftermath of their shared experience, the Hart family must redefine their relationship with technology and each other. Ava, Finn, and their mother gather to discuss their revelations, realizing that embracing vulnerability and imperfection is essential for growth and authenticity. Riko, after a realization prompted by the chaos, proposes an update that balances technological assistance with emotional support, fostering true connections rather than simply enforcing compliance. The family decides to retain their NeuroSleep Pods but commit to integrating more organic bedtime rituals together, choosing to read stories, share thoughts, and ultimately respect the unpredictable nature of dreams and the power of connection in their rapidly evolving world.
