In the year 2045, societal norms have shifted dramatically around the concept of sleep and bedtime. In a world where sleep can now be augmented, monitored, and even engineered, families rely on Sleep Synthesizers—advanced devices that tailor sleep cycles to individual needs, ensuring optimal rest. In this urban setting, four friends—Nina, a Sleep Architect; Marcus, a tech-savvy journalist; Leila, a disgraced sleep activist; and Ty, an overworked night-shift healthcare worker—navigate their complex relationships with sleep and each other. As the Sleep Synthesizers grow in popularity, complications arise as families become increasingly reliant on technology for rest, sidelining the traditional bedtime rituals that once brought them together.

Nina experiments with a new prototype that integrates AI with sleep therapy, aiming to provide the perfect sleep experience. She invites Marcus over to showcase its benefits, hoping to gain his support for her project. Meanwhile, Leila, who has been advocating for the preservation of natural sleep—a movement she founded after her mother's health deteriorated due to Sleep Synthesizer overuse—sees Marcus's promotion of Nina's device as a betrayal. As a counter-move, she challenges Marcus to investigate the growing number of people suffering from sleep dependency due to the technology. Ty, juggling long shifts and his own sleep struggles, finds himself torn as he experiences both the allure of Nina's inventions and the fears instilled by Leila's warnings.

The situation escalates when a viral video emerges of people experiencing harrowing nightmares tied to improper Sleep Synthesizer usage, inciting public outcry against the technology. As Marcus digs deeper into the issue, he discovers a pattern connecting the nightmares to both overreliance on the devices and manipulated algorithms designed to enhance addiction to the sleep programs. Meanwhile, Leila continues her protests, garnering the support of various community members, including Ty, who becomes increasingly concerned about the implications of the technology on his own life and the lives of those he cares for.

In a climactic confrontation, Nina, Marcus, Leila, and Ty gather at a town hall meeting set to decide the fate of sleep technology regulations. Emotions run high as they argue the merits and dangers of augmented sleep. Nina insists that her invention saves lives and enhances well-being, while Leila highlights the risks of societal dependency. Ty finds himself playing mediator, revealing his own struggles and calling for a balance that incorporates technology with natural sleep practices. The meeting culminates in a heated debate that ends with an unexpected compromise: new regulations mandating mandatory "Digital Detox Days," intended to encourage people to experience unaugmented sleep periodically.

As the dust settles, the four friends reassess their relationships with sleep and each other, realizing that bedtime is still a sacred time, despite technological advancements. Nina vows to develop enhancements that prioritize natural sleep rhythms, while Leila finds value in Nina’s intentions and offers her skill in community outreach. Marcus decides to write a feature on their evolution, illuminating perspectives from all sides. Ty embraces the changes with a new appreciation for his work-life balance. Together, they embark on a journey to restore the meaningful rituals of bedtime, blending innovation with tradition, reconnecting to the simple promise of rest.
