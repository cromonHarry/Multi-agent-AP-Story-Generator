In the year 2045, the concept of bedtime has transformed dramatically, no longer a simple ritual of winding down. In the bustling metropolis of Neoterra, citizens rely on advanced technologies that dictate their sleep schedules, optimizing performance and health. The SleepSync program integrates with personal devices, allowing users to connect to a global neural network where dreams can be traded and shared. Among the inhabitants are Zara, a rebellious teenager who yearns for authentic experiences; Jonah, her overprotective father, a SleepSync technician; Celeste, a dream artist who crafts custom dream experiences; and Eli, a wayward boy who has opted out of the program in search of unfiltered reality.

Zara resents the SleepSync system, feeling that it has stripped away the essence of youth and spontaneity. Her conflicts with Jonah deepen after he tries unsuccessfully to enforce her participation in the program during an impromptu late-night adventure. Meanwhile, Celeste is on a mission to create her most elaborate dreamscape yet—a destination for the ultimate bedtime escape. Eli, who is secretly drawn to Zara, begins to challenge her notions of life inside and outside the SleepSync network. The tension rises as a “dream trade” marketplace is being set up for an upcoming festival, and the stakes escalate when Celeste’s participation threatens to expose the darker implications of the program.

As tensions reach their peak, a glitch in the SleepSync system causes the network to crash, throwing thousands of users into a state of insomnia and chaos. Zara realizes this may be her opportunity to explore dreams beyond the confines of technology and drags Jonah into the streets, searching for Eli. Together, they stumble upon Celeste in the middle of a chaotic impromptu gathering, where those deprived of artificial sleep share stories and experiences, unearthing raw emotions and connections long forgotten. The chaos provokes a crucial confrontation between Zara and Jonah, as her frustrations with the network boil over.

In the midst of this upheaval, a unique ability emerges among the insomniacs—a heightened awareness that allows them to access a shared dreamspace without technology. Reccesses of deep-rooted fears and desires surface, sparking revelations among the group. Through this shared experience, Zara realizes that her dreams were never truly hers while bound to the network. Meanwhile, Jonah learns the value of vulnerability, understanding that embracing the chaos of life’s unpredictability brings deeper connections than imposed safety. Celeste uses the opportunity to guide the group, transforming their shared visions into collective art, embracing the chaos as artistry. 

As dawn breaks and the SleepSync network is restored, a decision looms over the once-enslaved citizens of Neoterra: cling to the comfort of curated dreams, or brave the wonders of reality imperfectly experienced. Zara and Jonah reconcile, having forged a new understanding, while Eli entwines himself in their journey anew. Celeste, inspired by their experiences, vows to reclaim her gift, promoting creativity rooted in unfiltered life experiences. The world rises as they stand together, ready to redefine bedtime not as an end, but as a doorway to conscious dreaming, fostering genuine connections beneath the vast, unfiltered night sky.
