In the year 2045, society has transformed "Bedtime" into an array of high-tech rituals aimed at enhancing rest and optimizing cognitive performance. The world is governed by a tech conglomerate named Somnex, which has developed the SleepSync technology—a system involving sleep pods, neuro-stimulation, and virtual dreamscapes that individuals use nightly. In this world lives Mira, a restless soul who feels disconnected from the advanced slumber systems; her partner, Theo, is a SleepSync engineer who believes deeply in the technology's potential. They share their home with Max, a skeptical activist advocating for natural sleep practices, and Aria, their daughter, who is caught between her parents' worlds, struggling to balance her need for healthy rest with the allure of the tech-enhanced dreams offered by Somnex.

As Mira grapples with her inability to adapt to the SleepSync protocols, she encounters glitches that lead to unsettling real-time dream experiences that blend reality with nightmarish visions. Meanwhile, Aria, lured by the shimmering allure of the augmented dreamscapes, begins to neglect her responsibilities, causing friction with both Mira and Max. Tensions escalate when Theo's project for an experimental SleepSync upgrade is announced, promising to synchronize entire neighborhoods for test trials. Mira's anxiety grows, fearing the loss of their connection, while Max rallies a group of dissenters, calling for a collective rejection of Somnex’s corporate control over nightly rest.

The night before the neighborhood synchronization launch, Mira’s subconscious manifests a desperate cry for freedom within her dreams. A dramatic confrontation unfolds when the family’s lives coalesce in a shared dreamscape, where Mira fights against the constraints of the system. With Aria caught between her divided loyalties and Max igniting a rebellion to seize their dreams back, they all confront the illusion cultivated by SleepSync. In this vivid realm, they must tackle their inner fears and societal expectations, forcing them to face the stark contrast between real intimacy and programmed connections.

As the dreamscape destabilizes, the family finds themselves on the edge of consciousness, grappling with the decision to embrace the SleepSync upgrade or fight against it. With differing philosophies clashing like tidal waves, they realize that their bond in the physical world can translate into strength in the dream world. Together, they channel their emotions to confront the manifestation of their fears—an entity representing the corporation's control—battling through a torrential storm of synthesized nightmares until they weaken.

In the aftermath, their victorious struggle reveals a new path. Mira, Theo, Max, and Aria awaken side by side, redefining what it means to "go to bed." They explore alternative methods to cultivate rest, a blend of technology with organic rituals, drawing inspiration from their communal experience. The world outside begins to shift as well, echoing their rebellion through grassroots movements advocating for balance between tech and nature in sleep. As they navigate their future, the firm belief in nurturing genuine connections becomes the heartbeat of their new bedtime routine, reflecting the essence of their shared fight against the homogenization of dreams.
