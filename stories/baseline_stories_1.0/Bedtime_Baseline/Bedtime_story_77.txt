In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into a highly regulated and technologically enhanced ritual. The world is dominated by a mega-corporation called SomnaTech, which has created a popular smart device known as the SleepWell Pod. These pods, marketed as the ultimate solution for a productive life, analyze users' sleep patterns and deliver tailored experiences that range from soothing sounds to virtual dreamscapes. Nora, a sleep technician employed by SomnaTech, spends her days fine-tuning the algorithms that control these pods, navigating the delicate balance between corporate demands and her growing concern for the mental health of her clients. Her best friend, Marcus, a former sleep researcher, frequently warns her about the dangers of dependency on technology for rest, while side-lining his own issues with insomnia. Meanwhile, Lia and Jonah, a young couple, face the challenge of maintaining connection while their lives become increasingly dictated by the SleepWell Pod's rigid schedules and stimulating algorithms.

As users embrace this dream-driven lifestyle, signs of unrest begin to emerge. Nora receives reports from concerned customers about unnatural sleep behaviors and vivid nightmares triggered by the personalized settings of their SleepWell Pods. The corporate response is to double down on advertising, emphasizing the pods' life-altering benefits and downplaying the complaints. Meanwhile, Nora becomes increasingly alarmed as she notices odd phenomena—families losing bonds over shared dreams that turn dark and obsessive. Struggling between fulfilling her job responsibilities and her obligation to her community, she recruits Marcus, whose research background gives him insights into sleep sciences, to investigate the claims further. They enlist Lia and Jonah, who have experienced the unsettling side effects firsthand: Lia has begun sleepwalking, often reenacting disturbing scenes from their dreams, while Jonah feels an unshakeable anxiety about losing touch with reality.

The tension peaks when Nora, Marcus, Lia, and Jonah uncover a shocking truth: the SleepWell Pod's algorithm is exposing users to hypnotic suggestions during their sleep, eroding their individuality and creating a hive-mind effect. As the group delves deeper, they discover a hidden feature within the device that allows it to track users for commercial gain. Determined to expose SomnaTech and save their community from losing their identities, the four friends stage a plan to infiltrate the corporate headquarters and reveal the exploitation to the public. As they navigate the labyrinth of corporate surveillance and tight security, the psychological battle intensifies, binding them together.

Driven by urgency, they finally reach the room containing the central control unit for the pods. In a dramatic confrontation with the CEO of SomnaTech, they learn that she has been manipulating public perception and user data to maintain control over societal sleep patterns. As they fight to shut down the pods and release the control over dreams, tensions flare, and Nora faces a choice that could shape their futures: surrender to the comfort of pre-programmed sleep or embrace the chaos of authentic, uncontrolled dreaming.

Emerging from the conflict, the group dismantles the SleepWell Pods, leading to a revival of natural sleep routines in their community. People reconnect by sharing sleep stories rather than synthetic dreams, exploring the richness of their own imaginations. While some have struggled to regain their footing in an unregulated world, Nora, Marcus, Lia, and Jonah find solidarity in their long, introspective nights. They form a support group, guiding others through the process of reclaiming a world where bedtime is once again a personal journey of rest, exploration, and awakening, all grounded in the belief that authenticity is the true pathway to restful nights.
