In the year 2045, the concept of bedtime has transformed into a highly regulated and technologically advanced ritual, governed by a conglomerate known as SomniTech. Human sleep patterns are monitored through neural implants, ensuring optimal rest cycles for productivity. Families meet every evening in their ultra-sophisticated sleep chambers, equipped with AI-driven dreamscapes that customize dreams to the user’s preferences. Four friends—Maya, a dream architect; Leo, a sleep hygiene advocate; Sam, an artificial intelligence coder; and Iris, a rebellious millennial—navigate this new world, each grappling with their own relationship to sleep in a society where nighttime is manipulated for maximum efficiency.

As children of the new era, Maya, Leo, Sam, and Iris grew up never questioning the sleep protocols put in place by SomniTech. Maya, with her natural talent for creating immersive dream experiences, is trusted with designing the latest algorithm for the corporate elite's dreamscapes. Meanwhile, Leo campaigns against the invasive nature of sleep surveillance, dreaming of a time when bedtime meant authenticity and not an algorithm-driven command. Sam spends his days programming the very technologies that reinforce this system, blissfully unaware of its societal consequences. Iris disrupts their routine as she begins to experience vivid nightmares induced by the very sleep technology they rely on, driving the group’s dynamic into tension and sparking discussions about the cost of their ‘perfect’ slumber.

The rising turmoil culminates when Iris learns of a secret hidden deep within the SomniTech server: the corporation has been manipulating sleep patterns as a form of population control, ensuring people remain complacent and productive. She enlists Maya, Leo, and Sam to infiltrate the headquarters and gather evidence. As they navigate the surreal and labyrinthine corridors of the corporation’s headquarters, they face tight security and a labyrinth of mind-bending dreamscapes that threaten to trap them within their own subconscious beliefs about sleep and productivity. The friends are forced to confront their fears and desires as they begin to lose their grasp on reality, with Sam's coding skills being tested to the limit.

In a dramatic confrontation, the group finally reaches the server room only to be ambushed by SomniTech's sleep enforcement drones. A showdown ensues where Maya uses her dream architecture expertise to create an escape route through their collective shared dream space, allowing them to manipulate their surroundings in an act of rebellion against the corporatized nightmare. Meanwhile, Leo broadcasts their findings through a hidden transmitter, revealing the truth to the world outside, forcing people to reconsider their relationship with sleep. As the chaos reaches a fever pitch, Sam manages to hack into the primary system, granting the public access to their sleep data for the first time in years.

As the dust settles, the group emerges into a world on the brink of change. The public outrage against SomniTech ignites a social movement aimed at reclaiming bedtime as a personal choice rather than a corporate decree. Maya shifts from a conformist dream architect to an advocate for genuine sleep experiences, while Leo becomes a spokesperson for sleep independence, highlighting the importance of natural rest. Sam, shaken by the revelation, pledges to code for consciousness instead of control. Iris, once a victim of nightmares, finds solace in helping others rediscover the beauty of unregulated sleep. Together, they embark on a journey to redefine bedtime, restoring a human connection to the night that had been lost.
