In the near future, the concept of "Bedtime" has evolved into a highly regulated, corporate-driven phenomenon. Sleep has become a commodity, privatized by tech giants that sell tailored sleep experiences through advanced neural interfaces known as DreamScapes. In this new world, citizens rely on Sleep Agents, like Elena, to curate their nightly escapades, ensuring they wake up refreshed and fulfilled. Meanwhile, Julian, a historian dedicated to tracing the evolution of sleep, becomes increasingly concerned about the cultural ramifications of this commodification. He often engages in talks with his childhood friend and tech skeptic, Max, who champions a return to natural sleep rituals, while Sophie, Elena's young daughter, grows curious about the bedtime stories her mother used to tell before the DreamScape era began.

As the government announces a mandatory integration of DreamScape technology into every household, Julian and Max unite to raise awareness about the dangers of relying on artificial sleep. They begin to gather data to present to the public, uncovering distressing patterns of addiction, sleep deprivation, and withdrawal symptoms among DreamScape users. Meanwhile, Elena, pressured by her company to maintain high performance metrics, struggles to balance her work and her daughter's increasing discontent with unauthorized bedtime narratives. When Sophie’s school announces an acceleration program for dream enhancement, she becomes entangled in the allure of DreamScape stories, igniting a divide between her and her mother.

Tension reaches a peak when Sophie, in a rebellion against her structured life, opts for a clandestine sleep-over with her classmates, who wish to experience the rawness of old bedtime stories. Encouraged by their enthusiasm, Sophie decides to ditch the DreamScape for one night and embraces a natural sleep ritual, forming intimate bonds with her friends. However, the sleeping children inadvertently tap into an ancient communal dreaming ability that leads them into a shared dreamscape where they confront and creatively overturn their fears and societal expectations. This wonder threatens to disrupt the corporate control of sleep practices, and Julian, hearing about Sophie’s adventure, rushes to empower the children’s experience through shared stories of resistance and humanity.

As the children awaken from their collective dream, empowered and inspired, they find themselves at the center of a media storm. Their experience draws attention, prompting a backlash against the DreamScape norms and igniting a campaign for reclaiming the natural heritage of bedtime rituals. Julian, compelled by the change sparked by Sophie and her friends, spreads their story far and wide, promoting the importance of authentic sleep experiences. Meanwhile, Max works with grassroots organizations to challenge the corporate grip on rest, attracting influential supporters from unrested adults seeking solace in true sleep, binding their movement together through the simple yet profound act of storytelling.

In the aftermath, the world sees a significant shift in perceptions of bedtime. Technology is no longer the sole provider of rest; instead, communities form to celebrate sleep as a shared experience, blending traditional practices with new forms of expression. Elena, inspired by her daughter's bravery and the societal shift, begins to prioritize her role as a storyteller, reviving cherished bedtime traditions. As families come together in celebration of authentic rest, Julian continues documenting the return of storytelling as he explores the impact of this movement. Now, instead of preparing for dream escapades dictated by technology, children and parents alike gather around to share tales of adventure, teaching that sleep is not just about rest—it is a sacred ritual that connects the living tapestry of humanity.
