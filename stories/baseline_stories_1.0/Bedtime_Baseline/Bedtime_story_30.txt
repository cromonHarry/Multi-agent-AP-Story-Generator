In the year 2042, the world has transitioned into a hyper-connected society, where "Bedtime" is defined not just by going to sleep, but by an elaborate ritual involving advanced technology. Children of the future, like ten-year-old Lila, prepare for sleep not with a story, but through a multi-sensory program called the Dream Weaver, which hooks into neural interfaces to craft personalized dream environments. Lila’s parents, restless corporate executives engaged in a never-ending work cycle, rely on the Dream Weaver to provide their daughter the rest and stimulation they think she needs. Meanwhile, Lila’s best friend, Sam, lives in a different reality, where her family has opted out of tech and embraces traditional methods of bedtime, fostering imagination and a strong bond through nightly storytelling.

One night, while Lila is engrossed in a particularly vibrant dream crafted by the Dream Weaver, a glitch—something utterly unheard of—causes the program to malfunction. Lila's dream world destabilizes, merging with a fragmented landscape of her fears and hopes. She finds herself alongside Sam, who has come to investigate an unusual disturbance in the region where they both live. The two girls quickly realize that they have been pulled into a dark void created by the Dream Weaver's glitch, and within it lurks the anomaly—a digital entity made up of discarded dreams and fears, irrational and negative forces that threaten to consume their consciousness.

As they traverse the chaotic landscape, the girls encounter Oren, a local hacker who has been monitoring the Dream Weaver’s systems for irregularities. Intrigued by their situation, he reluctantly agrees to help them navigate the glitch. Oren reveals that the Dream Weaver has been absorbing societal nightmares in its quest for optimal dreams, leading to distorted dream states and a build-up of unresolved trauma within its digital realm. The girls, encouraged by Oren, decide to confront the digital entity, believing it could unlock the potential for a new narrative for bedtime—one that embraces both the dream and the reality beneath.

The climax occurs when Lila, drawing on her understanding of storytelling and imagination, leads the charge against the anomaly. She summons memories of her happiest moments, which counter the entity's darkness with light. As the memories clash with the nightmares, the surreal battle of emotions unleashes a wave of energy that begins to mend the fractured dream state. Sam finds her own voice, crafting stories that confront the fears Lila never managed to face, empowering the pair to transform the entity from a threatening force into a guardian that protects the sanctity of dreams.

In the aftermath, the Dream Weaver has been updated to allow children to explore their own narratives, blending dreams with lessons learned from fears. Lila’s parents, realizing that their daughter thrived in a space that encouraged her imagination, begin spending quality time with her each night, weaving tales instead of relying on technology. Sam’s family adopts some of the Dream Weaver's features, striking a balance between tradition and innovation. Ultimately, “Bedtime” emerges as a collaborative adventure, reinforcing the importance of human connection, creativity, and emotional resilience, ensuring that no child must face their dreams or nightmares alone.
