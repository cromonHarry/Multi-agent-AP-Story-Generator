In the year 2045, society has adapted to a new technological reality where sleep is no longer a necessity. Enhanced neural implants allow individuals to optimize their rest cycles, often reducing sleep to mere minutes of restorative waves, making traditional bedtime an archaic concept. In this world, Eli, a young sleep architect, finds himself questioning the relentless pursuit of efficiency in life. His sister, Mara, an acclaimed dream engineer, creates virtual dreamscapes that serve as entertainment for a populace desperate for distraction. Their friend, Alix, a sleep activist, advocates for the natural restoration process of sleep, while Jim, an enterprising technologist, believes that sleep can be completely eradicated through manipulation of brain activity. As their paths intertwine in the fast-paced city of New Ambrosia, they discover a fracture in human connection caused by hyper-optimization.

Eli, motivated by increasingly vivid dreams that linger even after waking, invites Mara to join him on a nightly quest to pursue the remnants of genuine sleep, a venture contrary to popular belief. Together, they attempt to rediscover its lost art within the confines of dream engineering. However, the duo faces backlash from their community as they directly challenge the norm. Meanwhile, Alix becomes increasingly frustrated with the negative impacts of the sleep optimizations, leading to underground gatherings where she leads discussions on the importance of unaltered sleep. During one of these clandestine meetings, they learn about a high-stakes competition presented by Jim, who boasts a new technology that claims it will eliminate sleep entirely. Alix suggests they enter as a way to expose Jim’s nefarious motives, hoping to reveal the psychological damage caused by his innovations.

The competition, dubbed the No-Sleep Challenge, draws participants from across New Ambrosia, all eager to prove their worth and embrace the promise of endless productivity. As Eli and Mara plunge deeper into the chaos, they are forced to confront their ideals. Eli begins experiencing intensified visions during short sleep episodes—dreams about a world where human connections thrive and joy reigns in shared experiences, rather than the frenetic isolation that technology has wrought. As the challenge progresses, it becomes evident that Jim’s brain manipulation techniques lead to severe psychological breakdowns among participants. In a harrowing turn, several competitors begin experiencing panic attacks, unable to distinguish between reality and the nightmare echoes of their minds.

When the final round approaches, chaos erupts as the competition spirals out of control. Alix, with Eli and Mara at her side, devises a plan to sabotage the challenge and liberate the participants from Jim’s clutches. They hack into the competition’s systems to reveal the truth behind Jim’s technology, streaming the evidence to the entire city. As public outrage builds, citizens rally to support the revitalization of genuine sleep experiences, intimately connected to their emotions and humanity. Eli's dreams inspire others to reclaim their bedtime treasures, creating a resurgence of night-time rituals, sacred spaces, and community bondings.

In the aftermath, New Ambrosia awakens from its sleepless haze, as citizens reclaim the beauty of unstructured time. Eli and Mara embark on a business venture that focuses on creating cozy environments, where the community gathers to engage in sleep storytelling and shared dreams. Alix celebrates the newfound appreciation for bedtime, recognizing it as a cornerstone of mental well-being. Jim, stripped of his influence, retreats to rethink his approach, while society embraces its heart once more, reuniting through the simple act of resting together. Bedtime, previously just a routine, becomes a cherished ritual, allowing humankind to reconnect with the profundity of existence, fostering ties that technology could never replace.
