In the year 2045, humanity has developed sophisticated Neural Sleep Pods, devices that promise not only restful sleep but also immersive dream experiences tailored to individual preferences. In this world, the concept of "Bedtime" has morphed from a simple, biological necessity into a highly curated ritual, with families often scheduling their dreams together. Ava, a sleep designer who crafts bespoke dream experiences, arrives home to find her husband, Sam, and their children, Leo and Mara, already in their pods, preparing for a family dream. In this society, kids are encouraged to connect during shared dream adventures, as it promotes emotional bonding — a stark contrast to the isolating nature of modern technology. However, Ava feels uneasy about relying on these artificial experiences to forge familial ties.

As Ava begins her shift at DreamScape Studios, she notices a rise in complaints regarding the Pods. Users are reporting glitches; dreams are merging, memories getting mixed up, and there are whispers of a collective consciousness forming among users. Concerned for the impact this phenomenon could have on human connection, she meets with her close friend, Ravi, a programmer at the pod manufacturing company. He confides in her that a new algorithm, dubbed Collective Dreaming, has been rolled out without proper testing. It’s designed to enhance dreams through shared emotions, but early feedback suggests that it may be causing psychological distress, rendering users incapable of distinguishing between their own dreams and those of others.

As the glitches escalate, Ava receives a call from Sam. He is panicked; the kids’ dreams have collided with the collective dreams of their neighborhood, causing Leo and Mara to exhibit bizarre behavior, like speaking in languages they’ve never learned. Rushing home, Ava discovers that the kids are caught in a loop of other people's experiences, unable to wake up or assert control over their own minds. Desperate to save her family, she returns to DreamScape Studios and confronts Ravi about a solution to disengage the pods. Together, they navigate the labyrinthine programming of the Pods to create a fail-safe that could potentially sever the links between the users and the collective dreamscape.

In a race against time, Ava plunges into their pod system, experiencing the swirling cacophony of overlapping dreams herself. She visualizes a tether connecting her to Leo and Mara, and as she fights against the chaos, she draws on her love and memories of them to strengthen the link. This moment catalyzes a breakthrough; the emotional resonance allows her to reach them amidst the turmoil. With determination and a fierce maternal instinct, she activates the fail-safe, and they rush through the vortex of intertwined dreams, emerging in their pod. However, Ravi is trapped, unable to leave the collective, so Ava must make a gut-wrenching choice to save her children.

In the aftermath, the family learns to reforge their connections outside the confines of technology, pledging to uphold the importance of genuine human experiences over artificial dreams. With the Collective Dreaming algorithm dismantled, they begin an earnest journey of rediscovery, sharing stories and creating memories together—what true bedtime should consist of. Though Ravi remains lost in the dreamscape, his sacrifice sparks a movement. Communities start to gather for evening storytelling sessions, emphasizing real-life bedtime rituals that celebrate family, imagination, and connection. As citizens reclaim their nights, Ava finds solace in knowing that the true essence of bedtime—that simple act of bonding—has not been lost, only transformed.
