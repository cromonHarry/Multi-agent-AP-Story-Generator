In the year 2045, society has transformed the concept of "Bedtime" into an elaborate and mandatory ritual. It is now governed by the Sleep Regulation Authority (SRA), a powerful institution that employs advanced AI to monitor sleep patterns and ensure optimal rest for every citizen. The main characters live in a domed city called Aetheris, where artificial sunlight and the latest biotechnology create a seamless environment for humans. Among them are Nova, a rebellious sleep technician disillusioned with the restrictions of the SRA; Orion, a dedicated sleep coach who believes that the system is for the greater good; Celeste, Nova's younger sister and an enthusiastic participant in the regime; and Haxan, an underground resistance leader who aims to free the citizens from the mandated sleeping schedules.

As the story unfolds, Nova secretly tinkers with an experimental device that promises to enhance sleep quality but also harbors risks of unpredictable nightmares—a side effect unintentionally developed during its creation. Meanwhile, Orion works tirelessly to promote the benefits of the strict sleep regimen to the citizens of Aetheris. Celeste, enamored with the latest sleep-enhancing technology, urges Nova to join her for a new sleep trial—a virtual reality experience that promises the most immersive nocturnal adventure yet. Torn between her sister's excitement and her skepticism towards the SRA’s control, Nova finds herself contemplating whether to unveil her invention during the trial as a means to subvert the oppressive system.

The pivotal moment arises during the sleep trial, where Celeste, Orion, and a group of citizens embark on a journey into the simulated dream realm. As they drift into the virtual state, Nova clandestinely activates her device to test its capabilities. What was intended to enhance their dreams takes a dark turn, causing the participants to confront their deepest fears, manifesting nightmares in vibrant, terrifying detail. Orion, believing this is a part of the experience, tries to coach the participants through their horror, while Haxan, who infiltrated the trial, recognizes the potential danger and urges Nova to shut it down before it spirals out of control.

As the trials push deeper into chaos, the simulated realm becomes a battleground of nightmares, forcing the characters to engage with their fears—Celeste's dread of isolation, Orion's anxiety about societal obedience, and Haxan's guilt over his past decisions. Nova, desperate to save her sister and the others, harnesses her device’s capabilities to rewrite the dream scenarios, guiding the participants toward a collective confrontation of their anxieties. With each character wrestling with and ultimately overcoming their personal demons, they find strength in their newfound solidarity.

In the aftermath, the citizens awaken, transformed by their experiences in the dreamscape. With the SRA's control temporarily breached, Nova confesses her invention to Orion and Celeste, revealing that true sleep quality requires not just compliance but also freedom of choice. Inspired by their shared ordeal, they take the fight against the SRA to the streets, rallying citizens to reclaim their autonomy over rest. In the wake of their awakening, the once-opaque boundaries of "Bedtime" begin to dissolve, giving way to a society where sleep is embraced as a personal journey rather than a regimental task, igniting a silent revolution rooted in self-determination and the power of dreams.
