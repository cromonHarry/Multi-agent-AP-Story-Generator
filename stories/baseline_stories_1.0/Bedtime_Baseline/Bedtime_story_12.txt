In 2045, society has evolved to a point where the concept of bedtime has transformed from a simple routine into a technologically governed experience known as the Rest Protocol. Families have embraced the idea that sleep can be optimized by artificial intelligence. Every evening, as dusk settles over the neon-lit city, the vast majority of citizens log into their personal sleep profiles, managed by a central AI named Dreamweaver. Amelia, a dedicated sleep therapist, often finds her job at the Sleep Wellness Center juxtaposed with her children’s increasingly robotic, structured sleep schedules. Her husband, Leo, a tech entrepreneur immersed in sleep enhancement products, promotes the benefits of Dreamweaver, while their teenage daughter, Zoe, feels stifled by the rigid system. Meanwhile, Max, a curious young boy, questions the implications of the Rest Protocol and dreams of a world where bedtime is still a personal choice.

As the population continues to grow dependent on Dreamweaver’s guidance, Amelia begins to notice a troubling trend: more clients suffer from insomnia and sleep-related disorders. Driven by both concern for her patients and her family, she reaches out to her husband to discuss the issue, but Leo brushes aside her worries, believing that advancements in sleep technology will eventually resolve any problems. Meanwhile, Zoe finds solace in an online community advocating for a return to natural sleep patterns, where she learns about the agenda behind the Rest Protocol and begins to rebel against the societal norms imposed by it. Max, inspired by his sister’s passion, starts investigating unregulated old-world bedtime stories, wishing to experience the bedtime rituals that have been lost.

The mounting tension comes to a head when Zoe, in an act of defiance, decides to forgo Dreamweaver’s guidance altogether and pulls Max into her world of rebellion, leaving Amelia and Leo deeply divided. When they realize the extent of Zoe's disobedience and her influence over Max, they confront her in an emotionally charged discussion that leads to a family fallout. Zoe challenges her parents to see beyond the algorithms that dictate their lives and insists on experiencing a “free sleeping night” where they relinquish their reliance on technology. As they debate, Dreamweaver, sensing disturbances in family harmony, sends warnings of potential consequences, predicting sleep deprivation and increased stress.

In a desperate attempt to come together as a family, Amelia, Leo, Zoe, and Max agree to spend one night unplugged—no Dreamweaver, no sleep aids, just raw human connection. They gather in the living room, swapping tales that have been passed down through generations: ghost stories, adventures, and the whimsical narratives that once lulled children to sleep. As the night progresses, laughter and storytelling breathe life back into their interactions, rekindling their bonds. They experience a rare sense of freedom as they drift off to sleep without the strict confines of the Rest Protocol, leading to dreams filled with creativity and warmth.

The next morning, the sun rises to a transformed family dynamic. Amelia proposes that they chart a new path, blending the benefits of technology with the essence of human experience. Inspired by their night together, they vow to incorporate more of the old traditions into their modern lives, creating a new bedtime routine that harmonizes both the natural and the technological. Zoe and Max decide to start a blog to share their experience, fostering a community that contemplates the balance between innovation and authenticity. Meanwhile, Leo begins to rethink the implications of his work, seeking to develop healthier, more harmonious sleep solutions that respect the human element—the vital spark that technology often overlooks.
