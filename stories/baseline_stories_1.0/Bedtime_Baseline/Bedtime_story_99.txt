In the year 2142, society has transformed bedtime into a meticulously orchestrated event, overseen by "Somnix," an AI designed to monitor and optimize the sleeping patterns of citizens. In this world, sleep is no longer an organic necessity but a quantifiable commodity, with citizens using virtual reality sleep pods to access curated dreams tailored to their desires. Among these individuals are Lira, a sleep engineer who works for Somnix, Ethan, her rebellious younger brother who resents the artificiality of it all, Mara, a dream designer who specializes in children's dreams, and Rafe, an enigmatic dream hacker who disrupts the clean, controlled dreamscapes to expose their flaws. Each character navigates their own relationship with sleep, leading them to a climactic confrontation over the nature of dreams and reality.

As Lira becomes more entrenched in her role at Somnix, she begins to notice subtle but disturbing changes in the dream experiences of users. Complaints emerge about vivid nightmares in children, triggering a crisis among parents who rely on Somnix to provide their kids with comforting dream experiences. Meanwhile, Ethan’s defiance grows as he attempts to avoid the pod system, choosing instead to sleep naturally in their small apartment, disillusioned by what he perceives as a trap designed to control and pacify the population. In a twist of fate, Ethan encounters Rafe during a nighttime escapade in an underground community that has abandoned the Somnix system, igniting a friendship that could challenge the system's authority.

The tension escalates when Lira discovers that Rafe has been infiltrating the Somnix servers and leaking data about the harmful side effects and the manipulation of dreams, presenting a threat to her career and the entire Somnix apparatus. As Ethan becomes involved in Rafe's rebellion, Lira is torn between her responsibilities to the company and her growing awareness of its unethical practices. The siblings face a rift as Lira tries to protect Ethan from the dangers she’s encountered, believing him to be naïve about the implications of Rafe’s actions. The “sleeping” city, unaware of the brewing storm, remains blissfully ignorant of the potential demise of its once-revered bedtime ritual.

The climax erupts as Rafe launches a city-wide disruption, hacking into the Somnix system to reveal the darker realities behind the artificially crafted dreams. Lira must make a fateful decision: join her brother and Rafe in exposing the company’s hidden biases against natural sleep or defend the system that has been her lifelong commitment. The chaos caused by the hack creates a mass awakening, forcing citizens to confront their reliance on curated sleep, and testing the bonds between Lira, Ethan, Rafe, and Mara, who must now choose a side or risk losing everything.

In the aftermath of the disruption, the world undergoes an unexpected shift as citizens reflect on the meaning of true rest, reconciling their contrasting views on sleep. Lira, disillusioned yet determined, chooses to start anew, repurposing her skills to create a more harmonious system that combines natural sleep with needed support without manipulation. Ethan becomes an activist for sleep rights, advocating for an organic lifestyle. Rafe focuses on educating others about the truths hidden within dreams, and Mara takes a more nuanced approach to her work, blending the art of dreams with the essence of reality. Together, they forge a new understanding of bedtime—not as an escape from life but as an essential, natural foundation for living.
