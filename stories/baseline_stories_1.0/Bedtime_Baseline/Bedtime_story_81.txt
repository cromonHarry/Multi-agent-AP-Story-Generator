In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has become a relic of a past, transforming into a technologically enhanced ritual known as SleepSync, which customizes the sleep cycle for each individual. People now rely on neural implants that analyze their biological rhythms, habits, and emotional states to design a perfect sleeping environment, tailored to optimize rest and dreams. In this world lives Ava, a sleep architect who designs personalized SleepSync programs; Max, her younger brother who resents the detachment from real-world connections; Leo, a spirited dreamer who yearns for freedom from standardized sleep routines; and Nora, their mother, who clings to the fading notion of bedtime stories as an essential bonding experience.

As Ava prepares to launch the latest upgrade to SleepSync, she stumbles upon an unsettling glitch that provides users with vivid hallucinations reflective of their unacknowledged fears. Distraught by the ethical implications, she shares her findings with Max, who believes that technology has dangerously eroded the simple, grounding ritual of bedtime. Max has taken up the charge to reconnect their family traditions, urging Ava to recall the nights spent in the comfort of storytelling. Meanwhile, Leo, an advocate for more organic connections to sleep, starts vandalizing SleepSync installations around the city, believing that free thought can only thrive when people are unshackled from regimented sleep.

The tension escalates when Nora, after experiencing the side effects of a SleepSync upgrade, begins to lose her grip on reality, trapped in a cycle of nightmares that blur the lines between her dreams and waking life. Ava finds herself torn: she wants to help her mother, but also carry out the milestone launch of SleepSync which could enhance countless lives if the issues are resolved. Max stands firmly against what he sees as a danger to family and individuality, trying to inspire a protest movement that encourages real human connections, including bedtime rituals. They each stand at a crossroads between embracing technology and yearning for the warmth of genuine human experience, forced to confront their inner landscapes.

The climax occurs during the launch event for the new SleepSync, which Ava attends, fraught with anxiety about her mother's worsening condition and Max's impending protest. Just as she is about to breathe life into the newest version, her mother appears, drawn by an inexplicable force, pleading with the crowd that she'd prefer the heartwarming tales of bedtime over cold algorithms. This moment stands as a catalyst, igniting not only her resolve to prioritize her family's well-being but also an overwhelming revelation: technology should empower rather than supplant human connection.

In the aftermath, Ava decides to scrap the glitchy upgrade and collaborate with her family and Leo to create a new harmonious blend of technology and tradition. They set up “Storytime Sleep,” a service that incorporates storytelling and shared experiences into SleepSync, allowing users the option to intertwine bedtime stories with their personalized sleep cycles, bridging the gap between technology and the warmth of human interaction. Reshaped by her choices, Ava reconnects with her brother, bringing her mother back from the edges of her nightmares, while also providing a platform for Leo’s vision—a renaissance of genuine connection, reigning over a world that nearly fetishized detachment. The family stands united, resilient against the vastness of the night and filled with dreams that are truly their own.
