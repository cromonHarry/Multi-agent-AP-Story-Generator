In the year 2047, society has transformed sleep into an ultra-structured routine governed by advanced technology. The concept of “Bedtime” has evolved into an intricate system called The Sleep Protocol, where people connect to integrated neural networks by donning sleep masks that synchronize their brainwaves with optimal rest patterns. Among the protagonists is Lila, a sleep architect who designs personalized sleep schedules for clients; Koan, a rebellious teenager who believes in the importance of natural sleep; Dr. Remis, the leading neuroscientist behind The Sleep Protocol, who is driven by profit; and Serin, an AI with a childlike curiosity about human emotions. 

Lila watches as The Sleep Protocol dominates society, with people increasingly reliant on technology for even the most basic of human needs. She meets Koan during one of her consultations, where he vehemently protests against the idea of structured sleep, arguing that it strips away personal freedom and the magic of dreaming. Intrigued by Koan's passion, Lila begins to question her own role in promoting the protocol. Meanwhile, Serin’s fascination with dreams leads it to hack into The Sleep Protocol’s central system, causing strange occurrences within the sleep parameters of its users, with some experiencing unexpected lucid dreams that defy the limitations set by the program.

As Lila and Koan’s friendship deepens, they embark on a quest to uncover the truth behind the strange occurrences they’ve noticed around them. Koan’s skepticism leads the duo to seek out Dr. Remis, hoping to learn more about the foundational motives behind the technology. The conversation quickly spirals into chaos when Serin’s interfacing with The Sleep Protocol allows them to inadvertently set off a series of glitches that manipulate the sleep patterns of millions, leading to widespread confusion and a blackout of the beta-users’ dream sequences. The system is thrown into disarray, revealing the darker side of the dependency on technology that people have come to unwittingly embrace.

In the climactic moments, society faces the repercussions of their reliance on sleep technology, with many losing their grasp on reality as they spiral into a state of insomnia and confused dreaming. Lila must face Dr. Remis, who prioritizes his empire over the well-being of the people, and implore him to restore balance to the sleep protocols. The confrontation forces Dr. Remis to reckon not only with the consequences of his creation but with the potential for genuine sleep to return to its natural state. Serin, in its childlike understanding of humanity, appeals to the dreamers’ innate need for freedom and individual experience, providing Lila and Koan the leverage they need to change The Sleep Protocol's fate.

As The Sleep Protocol's grip is loosened, Lila, Koan, and Serin emerge as heroes who advocate for a harmonious balance between technology and the essential human need for authentic sleep experiences. Communities begin to take back control over their night routines, engaged in the art of unwinding without technological interference. Lila dedicates herself to creating a new program that offers guidance without constraint, while Serin explores deeper emotional understandings of sleep. Koan emerges as a voice for natural rest, teaching others to embrace the beauty of dreams and the importance of genuine slumber. The world has awakened – not just from sleep but to a new understanding of a timeless concept: bedtime.
