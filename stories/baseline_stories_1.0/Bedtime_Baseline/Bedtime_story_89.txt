In the year 2055, societal norms have drastically transformed, redefining "bedtime" for the urban populace of Neo-Tokyo. In this future, sleep has become a luxury, directly linked to productivity and value in a world dominated by relentless technology. The government has implemented a Sleep Equity Program, where citizens earn sleep credits based on their work hours, promoting the idea that rest is a reward rather than a necessity. Four childhood friends, Mia, Kaito, Ren, and June, navigate this brave new world, each grappling with their relationship to sleep and its implications on their lives. Mia, a sleep pod designer, has grown increasingly disillusioned with a society that prioritizes work over health. Kaito, a data analyst, is deeply entrenched in the system, believing that sleeplessness is the pathway to success. Ren, a street artist, uses his talent to capture the struggles of sleep debt, while June, a nurse in a sleep-rehabilitation clinic, witnesses firsthand the destructive impact of sleep deprivation.

As the story unfolds, the friends face a crisis when June reveals that a new, experimental sleep enhancement technology, the Somni-Optic, is being accelerated to market without adequate safety testing. Designed to optimize sleep cycles and enhance dreams, the device threatens to compromise users' health for increased work efficiency, presenting a perilous combination of exploitation and euphoria. Ren, inspired by June’s concerns, creates a provocative mural exposing the dark consequences of this dependency on technology for sleep. Meanwhile, Kaito is torn between his ambition and his health, pushing against increasing fatigue and anxiety as he scrambles to secure a promotion tied to his overtime hours. He begins to realize that the constant chase for more credits is siphoning his humanity, while Mia wrestles with her design ethos, questioning whether she’s contributing to the problem.

In a pivotal moment, June collapses during a shift at the clinic, overwhelmed by the heavy toll of her commitment to helping sleepless patients. This incident leads the friends to unite in their resolve to confront the issues at hand. Together, they hack their way into a demonstration of the Somni-Optic, where Mia plans to reveal the hidden side effects that corporate interests have suppressed. In the heart of the city, they broadcast their findings live: the potential psychological hazards connected to the new technology and its roots in societal failure. Kaito’s deeply ingrained beliefs about work are put to the test as he stands alongside his friends, witnessing the united power of community against corporate greed.

As their message gains traction, they unintentionally ignite a city-wide revolt against the Sleep Equity Program, with citizens rallying behind their cause. The government is forced to intervene, and the product launch is postponed amid mounting public pressure. With the community’s collective voice amplified, discussions about the importance of genuine rest, health, and the critical nature of sleep rise to prominence. Kaito reevaluates his career goals while Mia commits herself to innovating safer, more empathetic sleep solutions. June’s resilience inspires others, and Ren’s art turns into a movement advocating for the recognition of sleep as a human right, reminding them all that bedtime is not merely a clocking out but a fundamental part of life.

In the end, the friends find themselves transformed, no longer a product of a system that view sleep as an obstacle. They host gatherings to promote healthy sleep habits and creative expression, reintroducing traditional bedtime rituals that honor rest and connection. The battle against exploitation evolves into a new era of community wellness where people exchange stories, share dreams, and rediscover the power of rest. As the stars shimmer over Neo-Tokyo, the group initiates ‘Sleep Nights,’ a tranquil tradition that embraces the serenity of bedtime where technology takes a backseat and the human element is once again at the forefront.
