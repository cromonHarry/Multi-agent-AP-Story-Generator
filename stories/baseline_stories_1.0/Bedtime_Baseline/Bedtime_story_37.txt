In the near future, society has transformed the concept of "bedtime" into a complex ritual influenced by technology, social status, and individual neurology. People communicate with AI-driven Sleep Frameworks that personalize their nightly routines, ensuring not only efficient rest but also optimal dreams curated to improve personal happiness and productivity. Families like the Lanes, who can afford the latest sleep enhancement devices, look forward to their nightly experiences, while those from lower-income neighborhoods rely on an older version of Sleep Frameworks, leading to dreams that prompt insecurity and anxiety. The four main characters, a tech-savvy teenager named Kira, her sleep-centric mother, Dr. Mira Lane, her ambitious younger brother, Leo, and their no-nonsense neighbor, Mr. Harper, each navigate the changing world around bedtime through their perspectives.

As bedtime approaches, Kira becomes increasingly aware of the disparity between her family’s luxurious sleep experiences and those of others. Mr. Harper, a widower struggling with the gap between social classes, often shares stories of a time when bedtime simply meant winding down from the day rather than a curated experience. This sparks resentment in Leo, who feels overshadowed by Kira's success with their Sleep Framework and strives to gain approval from their mother by improving his own sleep scores. The atmosphere grows tense as Leo begins to obsess over the social aspect of sleep performance. Meanwhile, Dr. Lane's commitment to expanding their sleep technology business, while ensuring it remains accessible for all, leads her to develop an update that inadvertently narrows the gap but risks ethical and personal implications.

On the night the new update goes live, Kira invites Mr. Harper to experience the trial. Instead of the expected calming immersion, the algorithm glitches and reveals hidden fears and trauma encoded in each user's subconscious—dreams that expose connections to their past and even underlying societal issues. Kira finds herself drawn into a surreal dreamscape where she confronts her own vulnerabilities and fears for her family’s future. Meanwhile, Leo, consumed by his quest for perfection, has an epiphany in his own chaotic dream, recognizing the unhealthy weight of expectations he has placed upon himself and his family.

As the chaos in dreams spills into the waking world, slumber parties turn into anxious awakenings. Kira and Leo, alongside Mr. Harper, advocate for a revival of the old, more raw and unprocessed experiences of bedtime, shifting the narrative from perfection to genuine connections. Together, they decide to work with Dr. Lane, who has been increasingly unsure of the implications of personalizing sleep, creating a new initiative aimed at promoting community sleep health, which encourages unscripted bedtimes filled with stories and shared experiences rather than solitary tech-enhanced dreams.

With their efforts, the notion of bedtime evolves once again, integrating elements of community spirit and cultural storytelling. Families gather in parks during designated bedtime hours, sharing tales of old while reflecting on the importance of emotional security over algorithmic efficiency. Kira realizes there is value in authentic connections, and Leo finds newfound confidence within the beauty of his imperfections. As society shifts back to a more balanced understanding of sleep, Mr. Harper expresses relief to see the rebirth of simplicity, marking a new era where bedtime serves not just as a time to recharge, but as a cherished moment of togetherness, echoing the age-old adage that a restful heart leads to serene dreams.
