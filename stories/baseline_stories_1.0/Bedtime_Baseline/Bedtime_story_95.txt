In the year 2045, society has undergone a radical transformation in its relationship with sleep. Advances in neuroscience and technology have allowed people to manipulate their sleep cycles through neural implants, minimizing sleep to a mere two hours per night. The concept of “Bedtime” has become a relic of the past, replaced by “Sleep Pods” where citizens enter to recharge with vivid dream simulations and hyper-acceleration of REM cycles. As a result, families have grown distant, children rarely experiencing bedtime rituals with parents. In a modest urban dwelling, four individuals find themselves navigating this brave new world: Maya, a troubled ten-year-old longing for the warmth of traditional nighttime routines; Alex, her overwhelmed mother striving to maintain balance in a demanding job; Sam, her tech-savvy older brother who becomes obsessed with optimizing his dream experience; and Elara, the wise yet disillusioned grandmother who mourns the loss of time spent with loved ones.

As bedtime approaches one evening, Maya expresses her frustration to her mother, yearning for a story and the comfort of being tucked in. However, Alex dismisses her plea, rushing to prepare for a presentation that could threaten her job. Instead of seeking solace from her family, Maya retreats to the virtual world of her Sleep Pod, where dreamscapes can be molded to her every desire. Meanwhile, Sam begins experimenting with his latest dream-enhancing app, seeking the ultimate experience while neglecting his sister’s needs. Elara, watching the family grow increasingly isolated, decides that an impromptu family slumber party—a “tech-free” sleep under the stars—might spark some much-needed connection, despite the looming barriers of their daily lives.

On the night of the slumber party, tensions arise as the family struggles to adapt to the absence of technology. The initial excitement quickly gives way to discomfort, with Maya feeling invisible, Sam frustrated by the lack of stimulation, and Alex’s constant worry about work intruding upon their time together. Still, Elara encourages them to share stories from their past, to reflect on the warmth of bedtime rituals—such as hot cocoa, nighttime tales, and whispered secrets. Gradually, a fragile thread of connection begins to weave through their interactions, as laughter softens the edges of their isolation. 

Just as the atmosphere fills with the rekindling of familial bonds, an emergency alert interrupts them: a glitch in the city’s neural network has caused widespread Sleep Pod failures, leaving thousands in a state of unrest. Without their sleep-enhancing technology, people across the city are disoriented and desperate for rest. Panic sets in as the family realizes the potential dangers of relying solely on synthetic dreams. Rethinking their priorities, Maya persuades her family to help their neighbors and friends in need, to engage with a community that had faded into the background of their lives, realizing that human connection had always been a vital aspect of true rest.

In the aftermath, as days pass and the city adjusts to the disruption, the family embraces a new routine. Alex learns to appreciate a balanced life, carving out time for both work and emotional connection. Sam, inspired by his little sister's resilience, develops a new application focused on facilitating real interactions instead of virtual fantasies. Maya finds reassurance in the rediscovered rituals of bedtime, excited for stories and the comforting presence of her family. Elara beams, watching as the echoes of laughter once again fill their home. “Bedtime” in this new era isn’t just about sleep; it becomes a cherished opportunity for the family to reconnect and nurture the bonds that have kept them alive in a world heavily reliant on technology.
