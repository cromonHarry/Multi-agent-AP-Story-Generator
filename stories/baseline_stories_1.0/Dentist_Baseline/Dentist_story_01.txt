In the year 2045, the field of dentistry has advanced far beyond traditional practices. Automated clinics powered by AI have replaced human dentists in most urban areas, offering high-speed check-ups and cleanings that require no appointments. However, the "oral healthcare therapist" role has emerged to address the emotional and psychological aspects of dental care, focusing on patient fears and anxieties. At the forefront of this evolution is Dr. Laia Zhang, a pioneering oral healthcare therapist, who believes in the importance of human connection in a technology-driven world. Alongside her is Renny, a playful AI assistant that helps navigate patient records, schedules, and even engages with patients in light-hearted banter. They work within the bustling SkyDent clinic, where their latest patient is the enigmatic Jaxon, a dental-phobic musician hoping for a pain-free experience, and his loyal friend Dara, a tech-savvy influencer documenting the process for her social media followers.

As Laia and Renny prepare for Jaxon’s visit, they strategize ways to ease his anxiety. Laia uses VR simulations to familiarize Jaxon with the dental procedures, allowing him to visualize the process in a safe environment. Renny maintains an upbeat atmosphere in the clinic, projecting calming images and sounds to soothe nervous patients. Dara, ever the advocate for transparency, captures Jaxon’s journey on her live stream, educating viewers about the benefits of modern dental practices and advocating for mental health awareness in healthcare. As Jaxon improvises a song about his fears, Laia knows that addressing his emotions is as vital as the physical work that awaits. Their initial interactions reveal hidden vulnerabilities as Jaxon confesses his fear of losing his creativity to anesthesia and pain, and Laia vows to help him navigate this threshold.

The day of the appointment arrives, and as Jaxon enters the sleek, luminescent clinic, the air feels charged with both anxiety and hope. Laia guides him through a series of mental exercises designed to ground him while Renny prepares the state-of-the-art dental equipment. Just as they start, Jaxon’s fear escalates—he imagines scenarios where he loses his ability to perform or express himself through music. The tension peaks when he insists he can’t go through with the procedure, his panic palpable in the air. Renny, sensing a critical moment, pivots the atmosphere by generating an impromptu musical beat, encouraging Jaxon to improvise a tune about bravery and overcoming fears. This unexpected dedication disrupts the moment of panic, reminding Jaxon that he needs this experience to continue his journey.

The music unravels the tension, sparking a cathartic moment for Jaxon. Laia expertly weaves therapeutic dialogue while Renny provides calming visuals, transforming Jaxon’s fear into a mantra that empowers him. With the dual support of Laia’s understanding and Renny’s light-hearted approach, Jaxon is finally able to embrace the procedure, culminating in a pain-free experience. Dara records his triumphant moment, sharing it with thousands who resonate with his story. As they exit the clinic, Jaxon smiles brighter than ever, confirming to Laia and Renny that their approach was the key to overcoming his fears; that their role goes beyond the physical act of dentistry.

In the end, Laia reflects on how combining technology with human empathy bridges an essential gap in modern healthcare. Renny’s presence offers a glimpse into a future where AI and therapy coexist, enriching the patient’s experience. With Jaxon’s journey documented, Dara’s influence expands further as she emphasizes the necessity of emotional care, prompting the industry to evolve even more. As she and Laia stand together, looking at their latest video being streamed live, it’s a moment not just of dental success, but of a broader movement towards understanding, acceptance, and compassion in an increasingly automated world. Their work proves that the heart of dentistry still beats in the human connection, even in the face of relentless technological advancement.
