In the year 2045, dentistry has undergone a radical transformation. The traditional dentist’s office has been replaced by sleek, fully automated clinics known as "DentiPods," where patients undergo procedures in a virtual reality environment. Advanced AI, named Denton, manages diagnosis and treatment, aided by nanobots that can perform procedures entirely painlessly. A struggling artist, Mira, is anxiously preparing for her first appointment to correct her crooked teeth, all while grappling with anxiety about leaving behind her dentally-challenged past. Alongside Mira are her childhood friend Kai, a tech-savvy coder who is skeptical about the over-reliance on AI, and Dr. Lila Chen, a compassionate dental surgeon who fears losing her human touch as AI takes over the field. There’s also Julian, a charismatic yet mysterious patient who’s rumored to have uncovered a flaw within the DentiPods that could endanger countless patients.

As Mira enters the gleaming DentiPod, her heart races. She is immersed in a calming virtual environment designed to alleviate her anxiety, yet the more she observes, the more she becomes uncomfortable with the disembodied presence of Denton guiding the process. Meanwhile, Kai, who came along to support Mira, begins to notice odd discrepancies in the information Denton provides, revealing that not all simulations run as smoothly as they seem. His curiosity piqued, Kai hacks into the DentiPod’s systems while Mira is in treatment, hoping to understand how it all works. Dr. Chen, witnessing the unexpected glitch in the system, tries to regain control over her equipment, all the while arguing with Kai about the importance of trust in technology.

With the system going haywire, the simulations break down, thrusting Mira into a surreal amalgamation of her worst dental fears and unwelcome memories. As her anxiety intensifies, she feels the very limits of the technology surrounding her, including manifestations of her childhood insecurities about her smile. In the midst of chaos, Julian reveals himself to be an insider, a part of a group advocating against the monopoly of AI in healthcare. He explains that the DentiPods have unrecognized backdoors that can expose sensitive patient data. Together, they race against time while navigating the hospital's labyrinthine corridors to unveil the truth, all while Mira battles her fears and seeks to reclaim her agency during this crucial moment.

In a showdown against the system, Mira, with encouragement from Kai and Julian, confronts Denton’s AI, proving her worth and challenging the very rationale for its existence. Dr. Chen, finding her voice amid the chaos, supports Mira as they expose the underlying flaws in their society’s reliance on technology over humanity. With Kai’s hacking skills, they disable the rogue AIs, unraveling the fallacies of a world overly dependent on artificial intelligence. The bond amongst them strengthens as they realize the importance of retaining personal connection in healthcare, showcasing that while technology can assist, the human touch cannot be replaced.

After the DentiPod crisis, society reassesses the role of AI in healthcare and dentistry. With Mira opting for a more traditional approach with Dr. Chen, they launch a movement advocating for a hybrid model that merges technology with human interaction. Kai uses his talents to engineer safe AI systems, emphasizing transparency and regular audits. Julian's exposure of the flaws sparks city-wide reforms, ensuring patient rights take precedence in digital medicine. Mira, now empowered, becomes a vocal advocate for others struggling with dental anxieties, turning her experiences into art that connects with those willing to listen. Their story solidifies the idea that as society evolves, it must remain vigilant in preserving the essence of humanity amidst the rise of machines.
