In the year 2045, dentistry has evolved beyond the realm of traditional practices. With the advent of nanotechnology and AI, the field has transformed into an intricate blend of medicine and bioengineering. People no longer visit the dentist for routine checkups; instead, they rely on Subdermal Dentistry Units (SDUs), miniature devices implanted beneath their gums that continuously monitor oral health and automatically conduct maintenance tasks. However, Kyle, a disgruntled former dentist, longs for the human connection that has dissipated amidst the rise of automated care. He operates a small, retro dental practice that uses old-fashioned techniques, attracting a niche clientele who appreciate the artistry and warmth of traditional dentistry. Among his patients are Elara, a tech-savvy biohacker; Marco, a nostalgic artist; and Ava, a curious child dealing with the pressures of a world that prizes perfection.

As Elara finds herself becoming frustrated with the limitations of her SDU, which struggles to process new bioengineering advancements, she learns about Kyle's practice and decides to visit him. Initially skeptical, she becomes enthralled by his hands-on approach and the connection he builds with patients. Simultaneously, Marco is working on a mural that critiques society's dependency on technology. He is grappling with the dwindling demand for traditional artistry, striving to express his feelings about the loss of human touch in everyday interactions. Meanwhile, Ava, who has grown disillusioned by the relentless pursuit of perfection dictated by her SDU, finds solace in reading old dental analog books Kyle keeps in his waiting room.

The tensions rise as Kyle’s practice comes under threat from a powerful corporation that develops the latest SDU model, which promises flawless teeth and an even longer lifespan. They launch a campaign against Kyle's methods, branding his practice as obsolete and dangerous. Marco, inspired by the ongoing events, paints a mural depicting the stark contrast between the warmth of human care and the coldness of digital perfection, leading to an unexpected surge of public interest in Kyle's practice. Elara colors outside the lines by hacking the advertisements of the corporation, amplifying the message of connection and care that Kyle stands for. Together, they rally to create a community movement emphasizing the need for balance between technology and human touch, urging society to reconsider the value of personal care.

In the midst of this rising movement, the corporation stages an aggressive counterattack, deploying marketing strategies that shun traditional dental practices entirely, leading to open protests in the streets. As the battle between innovation and tradition intensifies, Kyle and his small team face emotional anguish, but their resolve carries them through; they host open days, storytelling sessions, and community gatherings to foster connections and educate the public about the importance of genuine human interaction. During a climactic town hall meeting, the trade-off between SDUs and traditional care is put to a vote, with every anxious eye fixed on the community's collective decision.

In the end, after an impassioned debate, the town agrees on implementing a dual-system approach: allowing a range of dental care options that blend the technological advancements of SDUs and the warmth of human interaction. Kyle’s practice thrives as the community embraces a hybrid model of dental care, blending human touch with technological advancements. Elara continues to innovate with her biohacks, Marco's art gains popularity, and Ava, proud of her ability to balance both worlds, thrives in an atmosphere where the fear of imperfection gives way to acceptance. This newfound harmony brings a sense of fulfillment, leaving the citizens to ponder the balance between progress and personal connection as they forge a future that honors both aspects.
