In the year 2045, dental care has undergone a profound transformation driven by advancements in biotechnology and AI. In the sprawling metropolis of New Neo-Tokyo, dental clinics have morphed into high-tech wellness hubs, offering services that go far beyond traditional cleanings and fillings. The protagonist, Dr. Mira Tanaka, a pioneering dental surgeon, operates one such clinic, which utilizes nanobots programmed to maintain oral health. With her assistant, a quirky, chatty AI named Kira, Mira has developed a reputation for changing lives through her innovative, preventive approach to dentistry. However, the rise of a rival corporation, Dentronix, threatens the integrity of her practice and the future of dental care as she knows it.

One day, a 16-year-old patient named Leo comes in for a routine check-up. Sporting augmented reality glasses, Leo is distracted and virtually connected to his gaming world while Mira asks him about his brushing habits. During his treatment, Leo reveals he’s been using a black-market app that promises a "smile upgrade," which includes modifying his teeth for aesthetics instead of health. Intrigued and concerned, Mira tries to explain the dangers of such risky upgrades, but the allure of instant gratification pulls Leo towards the dazzling world of illicit dental enhancements. Meanwhile, his tech-savvy friend, Zara, secretly records their conversation, planning to expose Dentronix’s marketing strategies that target vulnerable teens like Leo.

As Mira grapples with changing patient attitudes, she discovers that Dentronix has been contaminating the local water supply with a compound that erodes natural tooth enamel while promoting their products as the solution. Struggling to gather evidence, Mira enlists the help of Zara and Leo, who is torn between his desire for popularity and the reality of his health. The trio investigates Dentronix’s operations, uncovering a shadowy network of influencers and hackers working to maintain the corporation's control over dental culture. Tension builds as they plan to reveal the truth at an upcoming summit where Dentronix will announce their new product line—a plan hastily orchestrated by its cutthroat CEO, Anton Vega.

The day of the summit arrives, and Mira, Zara, and Leo infiltrate the event with a secret recording device. They manage to gather irrefutable evidence against Dentronix, showcasing the dire consequences of their unethical practices. Just as they are about to present their findings to the audience, Anton's security team intercepts them. A dramatic confrontation ensues, with Mira standing firm against Anton’s threats, revealing her commitment to authentic dental care and the safety of her patients. Kira, who has secretly been hacked by Dentronix, manages to regain control at a critical moment, broadcasting the evidence to the entire crowd. 

In the aftermath, Dentronix faces severe public backlash, their reputation shattered. Mira's clinic gains newfound popularity as more patients flock to seek genuine care. Inspired by their experience, Leo uses his tech skills to create an online platform aimed at educating teens about responsible dental practices, supported by Zara's investigative prowess. Mira's vision of a world where oral health is prioritized over aesthetics begins to take shape as the community rallies together, emphasizing the importance of well-being over superficial trends. With her clinic thriving and a new generation informed and empowered, Dr. Mira Tanaka stands at the forefront of a dental renaissance, hopeful for a future where caring reaches further than any advertisement could promise.
