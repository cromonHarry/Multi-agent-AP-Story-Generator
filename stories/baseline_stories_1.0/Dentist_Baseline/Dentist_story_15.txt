In the year 2042, dental care has transformed into a high-tech service fueled by advancements in biotechnology and artificial intelligence. Once a mundane visit to a dentist, it has shifted into an exhilarating experience. The world’s only Dentistry Rehabilitation Center, run by a charismatic yet enigmatic orthodontist known as Dr. Dray, boasts a fully immersive Virtual Reality System that allows patients to experience adventurous scenarios while receiving treatment. The center is globally renowned, attracting patients from all corners of the earth. Among the center’s clientele are Meera, a skilled programmer suffering from severe dental anxiety; Jake, a former athlete governed by an obsession with aesthetic perfection; and Mina, Dr. Dray’s intuitive yet skeptical assistant with hidden ambitions. 

As Meera prepares for her first visit to the center, she grows apprehensive about the VR system, fearing it may only amplify her anxiety rather than alleviate it. Meanwhile, Jake, who has been visiting the center regularly, becomes increasingly entranced by the reputation of Dr. Dray. He seeks not only a perfect smile but the same digital escapism that has entrapped other patients. Mina, observing both patients’ interactions with Dr. Dray, begins to question the ethics of the provider-patient relationship. She senses a darker undertone behind the charismatic facade of Dr. Dray, especially as reports of patients experiencing extreme and unnatural psychological shifts post-treatment emerge online.

During a session, the VR interface malfunctions, plunging Meera and Jake into a chaotic dreamscape full of surreal imagery and nightmares of their own making. As the system glitches, they find their realities intertwined, but so does their past trauma. Meera faces her long-buried fears from her childhood dental experience, and Jake confronts the hollowness of his pursuit for an unattainable ideal linked to his former athletic glory. Simultaneously, Mina uncovers a hidden room in the center filled with discarded technological experiments and video surveillance footage of patients becoming disoriented after their treatments, leading her to confront Dr. Dray directly.

In the aftermath of the malfunction, Meera and Jake initially feel empowered by their shared experience, now determined to expose the unsettling truths hidden within the center. However, Dr. Dray employs his charm, mesmerizing both of them into believing their experiences were mere figments of their imagination caused by anxiety. As they struggle with their own minds, Mina reaches out to top investigative reporters, leaking the information she found and rallying community support to hold Dr. Dray accountable. The tension escalates as they begin to fight not only for their own truths but for the wellbeing of countless others entrapped in a cycle of unchecked technological dependency.

Ultimately, the story culminates in a public hearing that brings together the Artificial Intelligence Oversight Committee and former patients of the Dentistry Rehabilitation Center. With Meera and Jake as key testimonies against Dr. Dray and the morally ambiguous nature of the center, the investigation reveals a conspiracy of altering patient memories to maintain a control mechanism over their loyalty to high-tech dental services. In a grand finale, Mina’s investigation gains more than fame; it becomes a catalyst for reform. The center, stripped of its former glory, is transformed into a community health initiative, emphasizing genuine care over technological seduction. Meera and Jake, having confronted their pasts, find new purpose in advocating for patients’ rights in a world increasingly obsessed with flawless appearances and virtual escapism.
