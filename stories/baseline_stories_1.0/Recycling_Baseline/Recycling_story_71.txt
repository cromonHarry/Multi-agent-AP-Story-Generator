In the year 2045, Earth’s reliance on a linear economy has been drastically transformed into a circular one, where waste is considered illegal and recycling is governed by advanced technology. Major cities are encased in giant glass domes showcasing lush, recycled ecosystems. The protagonist, Mira, is a resource retrieval specialist in New Mancorp, a city powered entirely by zero-waste principles. She lives with her younger brother, Jaden, who is fascinated by the underground movement known as the Rejects—people who oppose the strict recycling laws and seek to create items from discarded materials. Joined by her best friend, Felix, a tech-savvy hacker who specializes in refining recyclables, and their mentor, an older engineer named Aria, they navigate life within this ultra-regulated society.

One day, Mira discovers that New Mancorp’s recycling plant is hiding a dark secret: the materials processed are not just recycled to be reused, but are instead sent to a clandestine facility where they're converted into a new form of energy, severely impacting the environment in ways the public is unaware of. Determined to expose the truth, she convinces Jaden and Felix to help her gather evidence of the corporation's deception. The trio infiltrates the plant under the guise of performing routine maintenance, while Aria, monitoring them from a distance, provides guidance through a series of hidden communication devices. However, their plan becomes jeopardized when they encounter security algorithms that Felix struggles to bypass.

As they delve deeper into the facility, a sudden malfunction triggers lockdown protocols, isolating them within a secure wing. While they wait for Felix to regain control, the group discovers documents detailing how New Mancorp has been secretly stockpiling unrecyclable waste to generate artificial scarcity, which allows them to manipulate prices. The team realizes that the only way to escape is to not only disable the lockdown but also broadcast their findings to the world. With time running out and security guards closing in, Mira, Jaden, and Felix take a leap of faith, executing a risky plan based on Aria’s expertise to both hack the lockdown and initiate a live feed.

With Aria's help, Felix manages to momentarily disable the lockdown while Mira faces off against a burly security officer, allowing Jaden to broadcast their evidence to the public. The confrontation triggers an alarm, and in the chaos, the group escapes through a ventilation system, emerging outside the facility just as New Mancorp’s secrets are unveiled to the world. The public, outraged by the revelations of waste manipulation, protests in mass numbers against the corporation’s practices. For the first time, citizens unite against the oppressive recycling laws, spreading awareness about true sustainable practices and the importance of not just reusing materials but rethinking their overall utility.

In the aftermath, Mira, Jaden, Felix, and Aria become pioneers in the new movement aimed at redefining recycling and waste management. The group establishes a grassroots organization focused on transparency and innovative designs aimed at turning waste into resourcefulness. Strong alliances form with independent innovators and the Rejects, leading to a societal shift where recycling evolves into an organic process that honors both nature and technology. The city thrives on creativity, breaking boundaries as Mira reflects on their journey, realizing they’ve redirected society toward a sustainable future—a future where waste holds no power over the people, and innovation reigns free.
