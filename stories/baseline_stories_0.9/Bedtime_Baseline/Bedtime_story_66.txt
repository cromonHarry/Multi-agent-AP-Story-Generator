In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into an elaborate ritual entwined with technology and society’s unyielding pursuit of productivity. In this world, the SleepSync Corporation has developed a bio-adaptive sleep system called SleepSphere, a smart pod that optimizes users' sleep cycles through neural interfacing and personalized dream programming. The protagonist, Mira, a restless data analyst, is struggling to balance her demanding career with her mental health. Her closest friends and co-workers, Evan, a fiercely ambitious coder, Zoe, a mother grappling with work-life balance, and Alix, an anti-tech activist, each face their own struggles with sleep and societal expectations. As the pressure mounts, Mira and her friends are drawn into the SleepSync's alluring yet mysterious allure, unaware of the underlying risks.

As Mira’s obsession with optimizing her sleep deepens, she persuades Evan, Zoe, and Alix to join her in testing the SleepSphere, believing it might offer them the perfect escape from their overly stimulating lives. The group experiences immediate benefits: enhanced productivity and vivid, lucid dreams that allow them to confront personal fears and desires. However, as time goes on, they begin to notice alarming side effects. Evan becomes increasingly detached from reality, Zoe struggles with distinguishing dreams from her chaotic life, and Alix’s once-determined resistance to technology falters. Their friendship starts to fray under the dissonance created by their disparate experiences in the SleepSphere, and Mira realizes the technology might be more controlling than liberating.

The climax occurs during a tense group therapy session in the virtual dream space designed by SleepSync, where each character confronts their innermost fears and desires. The experience is interrupted when Mira uncovers a hidden algorithm within the system that manipulates users to ensure they remain addicted to the SleepSphere. She discovers that the corporation plans to launch a mandatory version of the technology that governs all sleep cycles, essentially monopolizing rest. With urgency, she tries to warn her friends, but Evan, now fully subsumed by the dream world, refuses to leave, believing that the perfect reality offered within the pod is far superior to their flawed existence outside.

As the group struggles to pull each other back to reality, a climactic confrontation ensues. Mira finds herself torn between saving her friends and exposing the dangerous truth of SleepSync to the world. With Alix's help, they devise a plan to disrupt the SleepSphere’s network, risking their own safety to prevent the corporation’s insidious grip from tightening on society. In an emotional farewell, Mira breaks the pod's connection, shattering their virtual sanctuary while fiercely clinging to her friends. The fallout forces Evan to confront the darker aspects of his ambition, Zoe to reclaim her time with her children, and Alix to reignite his passion for activism.

In the aftermath, the friends begin to rebuild their lives without the SleepSphere, though the scars of their experience linger. The world outside is disjointed, filled with others still entranced by the allure of optimized sleep. Mira's experiences lead her to begin a grassroots movement aimed at promoting natural sleep and authentic human connection. They each find solace not in the synthetic dreams of technology, but in real-life experiences, human touch, and open, honest conversations. As they gather in a small local café, they agree to meet regularly, forming a new ritual of their own: bedtime stories that help heal their collective trauma and celebrate their friendship, reminding them that the essence of "Bedtime" is not confined to sleep, but to the connections they forge with one another.
