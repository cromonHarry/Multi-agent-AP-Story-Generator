In the year 2045, bedtime has morphed into a meticulously scheduled and technologically enhanced ritual, crucial for optimal mental health. Society's obsession with productivity has led to the development of the SleepSync System, an AI-driven application that regulates sleep patterns, ensuring everyone gets their prescribed dose of rest. The protagonist, Ava, a dedicated SleepSync technician, spends her days troubleshooting this program for clients struggling with sleep disorders. Her best friend, Leo, an artist disillusioned with the rigidity of sleep schedules, resists the system, believing that true creativity thrives in chaos. Meanwhile, Ava's elderly neighbor, Mrs. Eldridge, refuses to abandon her traditional bedtime routine, finding solace in the rituals of the past. Finally, there’s Quinn, a rebellious teenager, who navigates her own struggles with identity and is embroiled in a secret group that advocates for "free sleeping," a movement aimed at breaking free from the constraints of SleepSync.

One evening, while fixing SleepSync at Mrs. Eldridge’s home, Ava discovers an alarming glitch – the program is manipulating users into deeper sleep cycles, rendering them unable to wake up without assistance. As Ava digs deeper, she uncovers a conspiracy within the corporation that created SleepSync; they are intentionally creating a dependency on their product to increase profits. Disturbed by her findings, she confides in Leo, who urges her to take action, while Quinn overhears their conversation and is immediately intrigued. Together, they form a plan to gather evidence and expose the truth, traveling through the neon-lit back alleys of their city to find more information from rogue techies who are developing counter-programs to SleepSync.

As they pursue the truth, their quest leads them to an underground sleep circle where members engage in “free sleeping” practices. Here, Quinn confronts her own fears of being an outsider and learns to embrace her individuality. Leo writes a manifesto, blending art and technology to challenge the notion of mandated sleep, while Ava wrestles with her loyalty to the company that employs her. The tension escalates when the group is discovered by SleepSync's security detail, forcing them to flee. In a dramatic showdown, they manage to escape but not without losing significant evidence. Armed with the realization that SleepSync has deeper roots in societal control than they initially understood, they decide to dive even deeper.

The conflict comes to a head when Ava, conflicted about her part in SleepSync’s operations, makes a bold choice to confront her employer during a live-streamed corporate meeting. She reveals firsthand her discoveries, supported by Leo’s art and Quinn’s tech expertise. Initial backlash is fierce as the company attempts to discredit her, but Mrs. Eldridge, inspired by Ava’s courage, makes a surprise appearance, confronting the executives with her own testimony about the importance of traditional sleeping rituals. The live audience, moved by the grassroots information, begins to turn against the corporation, creating a viral movement demanding autonomy over their sleep choices.

In the aftermath, as the movement gains momentum, SleepSync begins to lose its grip on society. Ava becomes a key figure in advocating for a balance between technology and natural sleep, while Leo’s art becomes an emblem of resistance. Quinn finds her voice amidst the change, becoming a spokesperson for young people advocating for authenticity. Mrs. Eldridge, celebrated as a champion of tradition, helps bridge the generational gap, leading discussions on preserving personal rituals. The world slowly shifts toward a future where “bedtime” is once again a personal choice, allowing individuals to reclaim their sleep under their own terms, fostering creativity, freedom, and community.
