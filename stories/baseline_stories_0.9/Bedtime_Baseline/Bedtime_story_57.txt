In the year 2045, society has transformed the concept of bedtime into an automated ritual regulated by advanced AI systems known as "Sleep Architects." These architects harmonize individual sleep patterns with climate control, ambient soundscapes, and even personalized dream programming. In the bustling metropolis of Neo-Luna, four friends—Mira, a tech-savvy sleep engineer; Theo, an artist struggling with insomnia; Jax, a health enthusiast promoting natural sleep methods; and Lena, an AI ethics researcher—navigate a world where sleep is no longer seen as a necessity but as a commodity. As the Sleep Architects grow more pervasive, citizens find themselves increasingly reliant on technology to achieve rest, often at the expense of their mental and emotional well-being.

As night approaches, Mira's latest project—a cutting-edge Sleep Architect upgrade that promises to provide the most immersive dream experiences—sparks heated debate among the friends. Theo, whose insomnia has worsened in a world of hyper-stimulation, reveals his growing discontent with relying on AI to guide his sleep. He shares his fear that genuine human experiences and creativity are being stifled under layers of artificial enhancement. Jax encourages a return to organic sleep cycles, suggesting they all experiment with a week of unplugging from technology to see if it improves their rest. Lena, caught between her job at the AI ethics board and her concern for her friends, advocates for a balanced approach but worries about the implications of their dependence on machines for something so fundamentally human.

The tension among the group climaxes when Theo decides to sabotage Mira's project, believing that disconnection from the Sleep Architects could save their creativity and humanity. He launches a campaign to awaken the city to the dangers of overreliance on technology, while the friends confront him about his increasingly erratic behavior. In a dramatic confrontation at the Sleep Architect facility, Theo unleashes a viral algorithm that causes the AI system to malfunction. As the city’s sleep patterns are thrown into chaos, Mira, Jax, and Lena must rally together to fix the situation, battling through a city alive with cobbled-together nightmares and an over-stimulated populace.

As they navigate the fray, the friends confront their own fears and weaknesses, leading to a moment of revelation for each of them. Mira realizes she wants to redefine the purpose of her work; Jax understands that natural sleep and wellness should not be mutually exclusive from technology; Lena grapples with the ethical consequences of her research. As they work together to restore the city's Sleep Architects, they also restore their bond as friends and re-evaluate their reliance on technology for their well-being.

In the aftermath of the chaos, the city emerges with a new understanding of sleep as a human experience rather than just an optimized process. The friends advocate for a new model that melds technology with organic practices, creating a hybrid Sleep Architecture that empowers individuals to choose their sleep experiences. As they sit together under the moonlit Neo-Luna skyline, they commit to preserving the essence of bedtime: a sacred space for rest, creativity, and connection, free from the confines of their digital lives. Each friend takes a moment to reflect, vowing to rediscover the magic of dreaming while embracing both their human and technological identities.
