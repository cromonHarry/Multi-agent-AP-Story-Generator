In the year 2045, the world has transformed into a hyper-connected society where technology governs every aspect of life, including the way people rest. In this new world, SleepPods—advanced sleep chambers filled with customizable sensory stimuli—have replaced traditional beds. The SleepPods not only provide restorative sleep but can also immerse users into vivid dream simulations tailored to their desires, memories, or even fears. Mia, a weary tech designer struggling to cope with her job's demands, finds solace in her SleepPod while her younger brother, Leo, revels in the leap into fantastical dream adventures. Their mother, Elara, a neuroscientist researching the effects of dream simulations on mental health, remains skeptical of the technology’s implications. Meanwhile, their estranged father, Ryan, a once-prominent philosopher, argues against the artificiality of the new sleep paradigm, claiming that it has stripped away the essence of humanity's natural rest.

As Mia immerses herself deeper into the dream simulations offered by her SleepPod, she begins to lose track of time, often waking up feeling disoriented and detached from reality. Leo, though still young and optimistic, begins to experience anxiety when he realizes he can only dream of adventures through the artificial lens of the SleepPod. Elara grows increasingly concerned about her children’s reliance on technology. She recalls the studies showing that prolonged use of dream simulations might lead to psychological dependency and a deteriorated ability to engage with genuine human experiences. On a whim, Ryan decides to visit the family, hoping to instill his old philosophies about authentic living into his children, but his attempts are met with resistance as everyone has grown accustomed to their digital realities.

The tension reaches its peak one fateful night when Mia attempts an experimental upgrade on her SleepPod, unknowingly pushing the system beyond its intended limits. The device malfunctions during her sleep cycle, trapping her in a nightmarish loop of failed simulations. Elara and Leo awaken to find Mia in a catatonic state, her mind entwined within the chaotic realm of her own creation. Panic ensues as the siblings race against time to restore her, calling on Ryan for help. The once-distant father, recognizing the child he once knew beneath the layers of technology, engages deeply with Mia’s essence, urging her to confront her design failures and reclaim her sense of reality.

Struggling to pull Mia away from the clutches of the malfunctioning simulation, Elara employs a radical design of her own—a new method of enhancing genuine human connection through shared vulnerability. She initiates a group experience using an old-school storytelling technique, where each family member relays their fears, failures, and dreams without the digital veil. This rekindles memories that guide Mia back, blurring the line between their shared past and the present as they experience the power of real emotions. As they delve into their real-life experiences, Mia’s consciousness begins to stabilize, allowing her to break free from the nightmarish loop. 

In the aftermath, the family emerges from the ordeal transformed and united. Mia embraces the importance of authentic rest, choosing to use her skills to improve the SleepPod technology in a way that encourages a balance between dreams and reality. Leo learns to appreciate adventure that doesn’t rely solely on simulation, exploring the world around him with renewed wonder. Elara, guided by newfound insights, begins a new research initiative that focuses on creating spaces for real sleep and connection, while Ryan reclaims his role as a father, emphasizing the necessity of human experience in an increasingly artificial world. Together, they find solace in a simpler bedtime ritual, cherishing genuine experiences over artificial dreams, thus rediscovering the beauty of shared moments before sleep.
