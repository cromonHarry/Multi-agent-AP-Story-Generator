In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into a hyper-structured ritual, marked by technological advancements and societal shifts. In the sprawling city of Neuropolis, where neon lights mask the sun's glow and artificial intelligence manages every aspect of life, sleep is a commodity tightly regulated by the Sleep Corporation. Each citizen is assigned a precise sleep schedule, monitored through Neural Sleep Interfaces (NSIs) implanted at birth, which measure metabolic rates and optimize rest patterns. Four characters navigate this brave new world: Maya, a 25-year-old sleep technician; Leo, her rebellious younger brother; Dr. Anya Verity, the enigmatic head of the Sleep Corporation; and Rhea, a hacker fighting against societal constraints. With a culture steeped in productivity, bedtime is no longer a gentle transition to rest but a mechanical process dictated by algorithms.

As Leo grows increasingly restless under the regime of enforced sleep cycles, he begins to question the corporation's motives. Drawn by hushed whispers of a tiny underground movement that defies the NSIs, Leo approaches his sister Maya, hoping she can help him navigate the digital web of restrictions. Maya, struggling with her own doubts about the morality of her work, is initially resistant but ultimately gives in to her brother's passion. Together, they venture into the shadows of Neuropolis, where they encounter Rhea, the fearless leader of the resistance. Rhea reveals that the NSIs not only control sleep but also regulate emotions and memories, subtly manipulating society for the corporation's gain. Together, they devise a plan to expose the truth and liberate people from their prescribed bedtimes.

The group’s plan hinges on an upcoming corporate gala where Dr. Verity will unveil the latest iteration of the NSI, boasting its newfound capability to eliminate dreams altogether. Disguised as corporate employees, Maya and Leo infiltrate the event, armed with encrypted devices designed to disrupt the system. As they navigate the luxurious halls filled with influential figures, they feel the oppressive weight of the Sleep Corporation's power. Meanwhile, Rhea orchestrates a diversion outside, rallying the underground to temporarily disable the city's grid, creating the chaos needed to disrupt the gala. As Maya confronts Dr. Verity in a tense standoff, she uncovers her own family’s connection to the corporation, leading to an emotional confrontation where Maya must choose between her loyalty to her brother and her own heritage.

When the disruption reaches a critical point, alarms blare throughout the gala, sending guests into a panic. Leo manages to reset the NSIs for everyone in attendance, allowing them to choose their sleep schedules for the first time. However, just as success seems imminent, Dr. Verity reveals she anticipated their move and activates a lockdown protocol. With Rhea's help, the group engages in a chaotic escape, barely eluding capture as they navigate through the chaos of the city now crackling with liberated energy. They become symbols of a movement that stirs across Neuropolis, highlighting a growing discontent among citizens who long for true autonomy over their lives.

In the aftermath, the Sleep Corporation begins to crumble as public opinion shifts against its control. Maya, Leo, and Rhea emerge as leaders of a burgeoning movement that champions the right to sleep freely. With the NSIs now deactivated for many, citizens reclaim their bedtime rituals, finding joy in the simple act of choosing their own rest. As they celebrate their small victories, Maya and Leo reflect on their journey and the importance of dreams — not just while sleeping, but as hopes for a future where autonomy and individuality are once again cherished. The world begins to change, one bedtime at a time.
