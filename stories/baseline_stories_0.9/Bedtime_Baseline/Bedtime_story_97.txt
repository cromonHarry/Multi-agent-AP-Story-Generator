In the not-so-distant future, bedtime has evolved from a simple routine into a complex ritual governed by technology and societal expectations. In a world dominated by Sleep Tech—a neurological enhancement that enables users to experience tailored dreamscapes—children no longer simply go to bed; they log into their personalized DreamWorlds. Ten-year-old Mira, an imaginative girl with a flair for storytelling, longs for the simplicity of falling asleep under the stars instead of being plugged into her DreamPod. Her older brother Niko, a tech enthusiast, revels in the latest dream experiences, while their mother, Elena, struggles with her identity as a parent in a world where sleep is commodified, and their dad, Sam, battles insomnia and skepticism towards the pervasive technology.

As Mira becomes increasingly disillusioned with DreamWorlds, she discovers a hidden door in her bedroom that leads to an abandoned, analog dream space—a relic from the pre-tech age where children imagined their adventures without the assistance of programmed fantasies. In this secret sanctuary, she meets Leo, a rebellious boy from a neighboring district who believes in preserving the purity of sleep. Together, they share stories and concoct a plan to challenge the societal norms that stifle creativity and authentic connection. Meanwhile, Niko grows suspicious of Mira’s new friendship, worrying that she might be jeopardizing the family’s reputation in a world where conformity is celebrated.

The stakes rise when Mira and Leo orchestrate a covert gathering of children who long for an escape from the constraints of DreamWorld technology. Their clandestine meeting culminates in a daring group decision to spend a night without their Sleep Tech, sleeping under the stars in the abandoned dream space. As they drift off in the cool night air, they experience a taste of genuine rest and their imaginations run wild, generating tales of adventure and wonder that remind them of the power of their minds. However, their rebellion triggers alarms in the tech administration, resulting in a team of Sleep Enforcers dispatched to locate the missing children. The children’s dreamlike freedom quickly becomes a race against time.

As the Sleep Enforcers close in, Mira, Leo, and the rest of the group draw upon their newfound creativity and courage to evade capture. In a moment of unison, they merge their minds and create a collective dream that takes the form of a fantastical world, transforming their surroundings into a vibrant, ever-changing landscape. This act of collective creation amplifies their bond, allowing them to connect on a deeper emotional level that transcends the limitations of their individual dreams. Yet, just as the Enforcers breach their sanctuary, the children’s magical world begins to slip away, testing their resolve and unity.

In the aftermath, Mira, Leo, and Niko face the consequences of their actions as they return home, each forever changed by the experience. While the authorities initially punish them for deviating from societal norms, the powerful dreamscape they created leaves a lasting impact on the community. Elena and Sam come to terms with their own struggles with technology and parenting, ultimately deciding to embark on a new journey as a family that balances creativity with technology. In the end, they cultivate a new bedtime tradition—one that integrates both the imaginative simplicity of bedtime stories and the wonders of DreamTech, paving the way for a future where dreams remain a cherished, unfiltered part of childhood.
