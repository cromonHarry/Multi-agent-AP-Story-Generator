In the year 2045, society has transformed its understanding of sleep, harnessing advanced neurotechnology to optimize rest. The concept of "Bedtime" now revolves around the Sleep Synchronization Units (SSUs)—smart beds that allow individuals to program their sleep patterns, influencing their dreams and even enhancing mental faculties. The world is dominated by the Sleep Idealists, a faction advocating for holistic sleep experiences, and the Dream Coders, technologists who manipulate dreams for entertainment and profit. Among them are Aiden, a Sleep Idealist who believes in natural sleep methods; Mara, a Dream Coder who designs immersive dream experiences; Theo, a child prodigy inventor, and Lila, Aiden's younger sister who struggles with her identity in the rapidly evolving society. 

Aiden wrestles with the repercussions of SSUs on human connections, insisting that true sleep should be organic and free from manipulation, while Mara thrives on the buzz of creating increasingly popular dream experiences that distort reality. As children like Lila become apathetic and detached from genuine emotions, Aiden and Theo set out to create a device that promotes a natural sleep state, rejecting the mind-altering effects of the SSUs. Lila, however, is drawn into Mara's world, enticed by the idea of experiencing adventures and fantasies every night. The siblings find themselves at odds, as Aiden worries about Lila losing touch with reality while she yearns for escapism, diving deeper into a fabricated world crafted by Mara.

The tension escalates when Aiden, Theo, and Lila's lives intertwine during a grand demonstration of Mara's latest creation—a night where participants could live out their wildest dreams without consequences. While in the dream realm, Lila embraces the experience fully, but as the boundaries between dreams and reality blur, she encounters disturbing manifestations of her fears and insecurities. Aiden, having infiltrated the dreamscape to save her, confronts Mara about the ethical implications of her work. The rave-like atmosphere quickly turns nightmarish for Lila as she is trapped in a representation of her fractured self, culminating in an emotional showdown that forces each character to confront their choices and beliefs.

As the dream experience spirals out of control, Theo uses his invention to initiate a system reboot, allowing Aiden to reach Lila before she is lost to her manufactured dreams. Struggling against Mara’s defenses, Aiden finally breaks through to Lila, reminding her of the beauty of authentic experiences. Lila, realizing that she had become ensnared in an artificial existence, fights against the illusion, breaking free with Aiden's guidance. Mara, witnessing the power of real connection, begins to question the morality of her creations, torn between artistic ambition and the consequence of emotional desensitization in society.

In the aftermath, the world begins to reevaluate the role of sleep and dreams in their lives. Aiden and Lila strengthen their bond, opting for collectively curated sleep rituals that celebrate storytelling and shared experiences rather than artificial dreams. Theo's invention is repurposed, offering a new kind of sleep aid that enhances natural dreaming without the harsh interference of SSUs. Mara, transformed by the events, dedicates her talents to crafting experiences that promote emotional depth rather than escape, striving to bridge the gap between fantasy and reality. Together, they initiate a movement that fosters reconnection among people, reminding society that bedtime should be more than a digital escape; it should be a time for rekindling relationships and embracing vulnerability.
