In the year 2047, the concept of "Bedtime" has dramatically transformed. Society now relies on advanced sleep technology to enhance cognitive function and restore individuals' mental health. Most citizens utilize a device known as the LumaPod, a sleek, pod-like structure that provides a curated sleep experience, utilizing neural stimulation and a blend of soothing sounds and scents tailored to the user’s needs. The protagonist, Ava, is a sleep engineer who designs personalized sleep algorithms for clients at Lucid Innovations. Her best friend, Max, a skeptical journalist, questions the heavy reliance on technology, while Yazmin, a single mother, struggles to balance her demanding job with her children’s bedtime routines, and Theo, Ava's younger brother, explores the allure of vivid dream adventures through the LumaPods at the expense of reality.

As Ava perfects her latest sleep enhancement program, she receives an alarming report from Max, who has been investigating a series of unusual incidents involving LumaPod users. Several clients have experienced severe psychological effects, including intrusive nightmares and a phenomenon dubbed “Sleep Deprivation Echo,” where their dreams begin bleeding into reality. Yazmin, seeking solace from her chaotic life, tests the new program for her own children, unknowingly exposing them to this untested technology. The tension among the group escalates when Theo becomes fascinated by the dreamscapes he experiences, neglecting real-life responsibilities and relationships. Unsure of where the line between improvement and danger lies, Ava grapples with her ethical obligations as a designer.

The situation reaches a breaking point when a child, under the influence of LumaPod-induced dreams, disappears on his way home, leading to a citywide panic. As Ava and her friends rally to uncover the truth and locate the missing child, they unearth disturbing evidence that Lucid Innovations may have been covering up the risks associated with their technology. The stakes rise as they infiltrate the company’s headquarters, where they discover a hidden project showcasing an experimental LumaPod prototype capable of manipulating dreams to control unconscious behavior. With time running out and the threat of a citywide shutdown looming over them, they must confront the corporation’s executives.

In a climactic confrontation, Ava faces off against the CEO, revealing her findings to the public via a live broadcast, pushing for accountability and the dismantling of the oppressive bedtime regime enforced by the LumaPods. Max records the confrontation, exposing the corporation's secrets and rallying public support for reform. Meanwhile, Yazmin finds the missing child, tethering the real world back to the fragile connections they risked losing. Amidst chaos, Theo emerges from his self-imposed isolation, bringing a sense of hope by sharing the importance of facing reality and cherishing personal connections over artificial dreams.

In the aftermath, the city grapples with the implications of their reliance on technology. The four friends, forever changed by their experiences, unite to advocate for a balanced approach to wellness, encouraging the integration of traditional bedtime rituals with innovative technology. They establish a community-driven initiative that emphasizes the importance of sleep without dependency on invasive devices. As families across the city rediscover the comforting power of bedtime stories and nighttime routines, Ava reflects on the delicate dance between progress and human connection, realizing that sometimes the most essential aspect of bedtime is simply being together in the moment.
