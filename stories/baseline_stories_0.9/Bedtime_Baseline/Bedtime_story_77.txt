In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has morphed from a simple nightly routine into a highly regulated procedure governed by the Sleep Regulation Authority (SRA). In this society, citizens wear neuroadaptive sleep masks that optimize their sleep cycles, ensuring productivity and health. Evelyn, a 28-year-old sleep scientist, has dedicated her life to studying the effects of these masks on REM sleep. Her younger brother, Max, a rebellious 17-year-old, has grown tired of the constrictive rules of the SRA and dreams of a life where sleep is spontaneous and unmonitored. Alongside them is Dr. Lin, the ambitious head of the SRA, whose obsession with perfection in sleep leads her down a dark path, and Rowan, a charismatic hacker with a knack for subverting the system, who catches Max's eye and encourages him to question everything.

Faced with the banality of regimented sleep, Max rebels against the nightly protocols enforced by the SRA. He begins to secretly research ways to circumvent the masks and seeks out Rowan, who not only possesses the skills to disable the devices but also represents everything Max yearns for: freedom and unpredictability. As their friendship deepens, Max learns of Rowan's plan to distribute an underground device—a prototype that allows people to experience natural sleep without interference. Meanwhile, Evelyn struggles with her brother's choices and her growing unease about the SRA's control over personal lives, leading her to investigate the consequences of the masks on human behavior and health.

The stakes escalate when Max, alongside Rowan, sabotages a public demonstration of the SRA's latest version of the sleep mask, which promises to eliminate nightmares entirely. During the demonstration, Max places a modified chip into the system, causing it to malfunction and reveal the dark secrets of the SRA: how they manipulate citizens' thoughts and emotions during sleep for compliance. As the audience watches in horror, Dr. Lin realizes the breach and orders security to apprehend them. In a chaotic confrontation, Max faces Dr. Lin, who reveals the true extent of the SRA's power, pushing him to weigh the importance of sleep against the right to autonomy.

In the aftermath, the public becomes aware of the manipulation, igniting a city-wide debate on the ethics of enforced sleep. Evelyn, finally understanding her brother's motivations, confronts Dr. Lin, demanding a reform of the SRA's practices. Together, they initiate a movement, leveraging the viral chaos created by Max and Rowan to rally citizens against the invasive practices of the SRA. The movement gains momentum as the citizens begin to dismantle the masks and restore their natural sleep patterns, igniting a broader revolution against systemic control over human life.

As the city shifts towards a new paradigm, Max and Evelyn reunite, understanding each other's perspectives better than before. Rowan becomes a leading figure in the movement, championing the idea that sleep is essential for creativity and individuality. With the SRA disbanded, the citizens embrace the unpredictable cycles of rest and dreams, fostering a newfound respect for the subconscious. In their newfound freedom, Max, Evelyn, and Rowan reflect on what it means to reclaim their bedtime, not just as a time to rest, but as a celebration of their humanity—where dreams are limitless, and the act of sleeping becomes a personal choice rather than a mandated ritual.
