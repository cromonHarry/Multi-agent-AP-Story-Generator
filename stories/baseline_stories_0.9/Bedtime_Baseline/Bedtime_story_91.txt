In the year 2045, society has entered an era where sleep is considered obsolete, thanks to the invention of the Somnodex, a neural device that allows for conscious rest while awake. This technology has revolutionized the concept of bedtime, transforming it into a scheduled pause for relaxation rather than sleep. Families spend their evenings in serene chambers, connected to their Somnodex through soft, ambient interfaces while engaging in virtual experiences. Marla, a single mother and freelance VR artist, struggles to connect with her teenage son, Leo, who has become increasingly immersed in the artificial worlds. Meanwhile, Cassie, Marla's elderly neighbor and ex-therapist, provides guidance and comfort to Leo, while Tom, Marla’s estranged father and a Somnodex engineer, tries to reconcile with his family amid the chaos of technology's impact on relationships.

As the story unfolds, Marla notices a growing rift between her and Leo, exacerbated by his obsession with the high-stakes virtual reality game, "Sleepless," where players compete for dreams they can no longer access in real life. One evening, Marla decides to confront Leo about his disconnect from reality. Instead of the expected argument, they find themselves drawn into a heated debate about the value of traditional bedtime rituals like reading and talking—a discussion that is overheard by Cassie, who intervenes with her own experiences of emotional nourishment from her past counseling sessions. Meanwhile, Tom, who has been returning to the family house after years, discovers the growing concern between Marla and Leo over their seemingly endless reliance on technology.

The climax occurs during a scheduled family “rest” period when the Somnodex malfunctions and traps the users in a shared dreamscape. Marla, Leo, Cassie, and Tom find themselves in a twisted version of their memories, echoing the deeper emotional fractures that have plagued their relationships. As they navigate this surreal realm, each character confronts their own fears and regrets—Marla's loss of connection, Leo's fear of inadequacy, Cassie's memories of her late husband, and Tom's guilt over abandoning his family. In this shared space, they must work together to unlock their individual traumas and escape the dreamscape, leading to moments of vulnerability and strength among them.

After an arduous struggle, the four manage to awaken, their spirits renewed and relationships mended. The experience serves as a catalyst for change as each character embraces the need for genuine connections over synthetic experiences. Marla decides to reduce the time spent in the Somnodex, initiating traditional bedtime rituals and encouraging Leo to share his dreams, fears, and aspirations. With Cassie's support, they begin to reconstruct their evening routines, allowing storytelling and laughter to take the place of digital distractions. At the same time, Tom steps up, repairing his bond with Marla and Leo, fully committing to being part of their lives again.

In the final scene, the four sit together in the living room, surrounded by warm light and the sound of each other’s voices. They share stories, play classic games, and embrace the simple joy of being together. As they turn off their devices and disconnect from the machine, the room fills with laughter and sincerity—the true essence of "bedtime" in this new age. It is a poignant reminder that while technology has the potential to create distance, it can also bring people together when used thoughtfully. The narrative concludes with a sense of hope, illustrating that even in an advanced world, the need for human connection remains timeless and essential.
