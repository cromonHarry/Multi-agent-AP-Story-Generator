In the year 2042, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into something unrecognizable. Society has embraced advanced technologies that allow for total manipulation of the sleep experience. The Sleep Enhancement Protocol (SEP) is widely used, enabling individuals not only to control the duration and depth of sleep but also to customize dreams to personal preferences. In this world, 16-year-old Nia is grappling with her new reality. She feels increasingly disconnected from her peers, who seem absorbed in vivid dreamscapes tailored by SEP. Opposite her is Theo, her younger brother, who eagerly embraces the technology, believing it to be a gateway to creativity and happiness. Their mother, Elara, is a bioengineer working on enhancing the dream-tech, while their father, Amir, is a traditionalist, advocating for the value of unaided sleep and natural dreaming.

As Nia navigates her discontent, she feels compelled to connect with an underground group that rejects the use of SEP. This group, known as the Dreamwalkers, believes in the power of unaltered dreams—a stark contrast to the hyper-realistic fantasies crafted by the protocol. They explore the idea that true creativity and self-discovery lie in the raw emotions and experiences during natural sleep. Among the Dreamwalkers is Zane, a charismatic leader whose tales of dream experiences resonate with Nia. Despite her reservations about their methods, Nia becomes drawn to Zane’s vision of rediscovering the forgotten art of dreaming without interference.

The tension escalates when Elara invites Nia to partake in a revolutionary experiment designed to enhance the SEP even further, potentially allowing users to share dreams, blurring the line between individual experiences. Nia feels torn between her loyalty to her mother and her burgeoning belief in the Dreamwalkers’ cause. During a clandestine meeting with Zane and the Dreamwalkers, Nia learns of an impending protest against the SEP's oppressive hold on society, aimed at advocating for a return to natural sleep. This mission resonates deeply with her, igniting a fierce desire to take action. The stakes grow high as Elara's project nears completion, casting a shadow over Nia's newfound convictions.

On the night of the protest, the atmosphere is electric. Nia stands at the forefront, rallying her fellow Dreamwalkers, ready to confront the technological behemoth that threatens to consume their minds. As Elara’s trial becomes public news, the event escalates into chaos when security personnel arrive to dismantle the protest. In the heat of the moment, Nia confronts her mother, who sees the protest as a threat to her groundbreaking work. Their emotional clash reveals deep-seated fears about identity, control, and the essence of humanity itself. As Nia dares to shut off her SEP implants, plunging into the unfiltered realm of natural sleep, the space around her shifts, manifesting a visceral world of dreams filled with echoes of unarticulated fears and desires.

In the aftermath of the protest, society finds itself at a crossroads. The stark reality of living without the SEP begins to gain traction, leading many to question their dependency on dream technology. Nia’s bravery inspires others to reconnect with their natural sleeping states, and a movement for balance emerges—a fusion of technology and human experience. Elara, witnessing the shift in societal perception, reevaluates her work, contemplating how to integrate natural dreaming into future enhancements. Meanwhile, Nia, Theo, Zane, and Amir forge a new understanding; the family learns to navigate their differences, cherishing both the vulnerability of natural dreams and the wonders of technology, ultimately redefining "Bedtime" not as a constraint, but as an opportunity for shared experiences and genuine connection.
