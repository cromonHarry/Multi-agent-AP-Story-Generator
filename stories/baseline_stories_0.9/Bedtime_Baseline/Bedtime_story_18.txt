In the year 2045, the concept of “Bedtime” has transformed from a simple ritual into a multi-faceted experience governed by technology and societal expectations. People rely on biometric sleep enhancement devices called Somnispheres, which analyze and optimize sleep patterns. The world is buzzing with “Sleep Coaches”, professionals who guide citizens through sleep training programs to achieve maximum restorative sleep, often influenced by societal pressures to perform. Among these characters is Lila, a weary Sleep Coach struggling to balance the demands of her clients with her own mental health; Ethan, her innovative but disconnected husband who has become obsessed with developing a new AI designed to eliminate nightmares; Sara, Lila's ambitious client chasing her dreams of becoming a top performer in a hyper-competitive world, and Finn, a mischievous young boy who believes the magic of bedtime stories—now obsolete—still holds power.

The daily struggle of bedtime routines reaches a boiling point as Lila realizes the rampant obsession over perfect sleep is causing anxiety and unhappiness among her clients. She watches as Sara, despite achieving the highest sleep scores, remains unfulfilled, and Ethan's relentless drive to eradicate nightmares pushes him further away from their connection. Finn, diagnosed with a sleep disorder and tired of the gadgets that strip away the essence of bedtime, discovers a hidden library of old bedtime stories in the attic. He begins telling these tales to the neighborhood kids, sparking a revival of interest in traditional storytelling that resonates with their imaginations, offering solace and comfort.

As Lila witnesses Finn's impact on the children, she becomes inspired to confront the sterile world of sleep optimization. She decides to host a community event, encouraging families to share stories, both old and new, in hopes of rediscovering the emotional connection lost to technology. However, Ethan disapproves; he insists the future lies in his AI, which promises to end all sleep disturbances. Tensions rise as Lila struggles with her love for Ethan and her desire to champion the forgotten beauty of bedtime rituals. She faces a choice: to support Ethan’s vision or stand by Finn and the children, fostering human connection through storytelling.

The community event unfolds as a battle between the digital and the tangible. Lila’s event, filled with laughter, storytelling, and warmth, contrasts sharply with the sterile, automated sleep experiences of the Somnispheres. People begin to reflect on the memories tied to traditional bedtime routines as they share their stories, highlighting the emotional richness that technology often overlooks. Ethan, witnessing the joy and connection blossoming around him, experiences a revelation about the importance of human experience over mere optimization. He realizes that dreams and fears are essential parts of existence, which his AI could never truly replicate.

In the aftermath of the event, Lila finds a way to integrate her knowledge as a Sleep Coach with the narratives shared by the community, establishing a new framework that honors both emotional wellness and the potential of technology. Ethan, inspired by Lila and the stories, decides to refocus his AI project towards enhancing the storytelling experience rather than replacing it. Sara, now motivated by the community's support, discovers her unique talent for weaving stories and begins to pursue her creativity more authentically. Finn becomes a local hero, a champion of bedtime stories, reminding everyone that the heart of “Bedtime” lies not in the hours counted but in the connections made under the stars.
