In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into a highly regulated and technologically integrated ritual, designed to enhance mental and physical well-being through advanced sleep science. The world has been divided into Sleep Zones, where high-tech sleep pods monitor users’ biosignals to optimize their rest cycles. Despite these advancements, the traditional idea of bedtime is still cherished by some, especially in the quaint town of New Haven. Here, four friends—Maris, a sleep scientist; Theo, a rebellious artist; Lila, a nursing student; and Zara, a virtual reality programmer—meet every night to reminisce about the old world and share stories that evoke the nostalgia of simpler times. They often gather at the local park, away from the pervasive hum of technology, to explore the beautiful art of storytelling before entering their individual Sleep Zones.

As the government announces new regulations enforcing mandatory sleep cycles tied to productivity metrics, anxiety builds among the friends. Maris, being the scientist, tries to explain the logic behind the government's decision, while Theo rebels against the idea of being treated like a machine. Lila feels torn, caught between her rigorous nursing duties and the desire to disconnect from the stress of her demanding life. Meanwhile, Zara secretly develops a virtual reality project designed to recreate the experience of unregulated bedtime—a place where dreams run wild without the inhibitions of technology. The friends begin to consider the implications of this new norm, questioning what humanity might lose in the pursuit of optimized sleep and relentless productivity.

One night, after a particularly heated debate about the government’s control over their lives, there is an unexpected power outage in the Sleep Zones. Without their sleep pods’ guidance, the friends are forced to confront their own dreams and fears in a more primal way. In the absence of technology, Theo proposes an impromptu storytelling session by the light of a small campfire. As each friend shares their deepest dreams, aspirations, and vulnerabilities, they find comfort and strength in their shared experiences. However, this moment of bonding is disrupted when an enforcement drone begins scanning the area, searching for infractions against the new sleep laws.

The friends must quickly decide whether to flee or stand their ground. Maris suggests that they hack one of the enforcement drones using Zara’s VR program, turning it into a distraction while they escape into the woods. United by their newfound solidarity, the friends implement Zara’s VR tech to create an illusion, confusing the drone and evading capture. During their escape, they reflect on the importance of human connection, storytelling, and unregulated dreams, realizing that these fleeting moments are essential to their humanity and self-identity.

In the aftermath of the night’s events, they return to the park to regroup and plan their next steps. Inspired by their experience, Maris and Lila decide to start a grassroots campaign to advocate for autonomy over sleeping habits, while Theo creates a series of art pieces that depict dreams untethered by technology. Zara's VR program becomes a symbol of rebellion, evolving into a platform that allows people to share their stories and dreams freely. The friends, now more than just companions but a tight-knit team dedicated to reclaiming the essence of bedtime, understand that sometimes it takes darkness to appreciate the light of human connection.
