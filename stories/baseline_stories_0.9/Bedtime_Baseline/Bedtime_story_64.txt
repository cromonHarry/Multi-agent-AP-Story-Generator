In the year 2045, society has transformed bedtime into a high-tech ritual, where sleep is monitored, optimized, and enhanced by advanced AI. The world is populated by millions of “SomnoTech” pods—biometric sleeping capsules designed to create the perfect sleep environment for every individual. In the heart of Neo-Tokyo, four friends navigate this brave new world: Mira, a sleep scientist enthralled by the potential of her inventions; Leo, a freelance journalist skeptical of the pervasive technology; Tasha, a sleep therapist advocating for the importance of natural rest; and Kian, a virtual reality designer who has created immersive dreamscapes that can be experienced while sleeping. Together, they explore the intersections of technology, health, and the human experience, but each harbors their own hidden struggles related to the new norms of bedtime.

As Mira prepares to launch a groundbreaking update to the SomnoTech system, she invites her friends to a prototype testing session in her lab. Excited yet apprehensive, they each step into their pods, ready to experience the latest features, including dream simulation and real-time emotional monitoring. While inside, they quickly realize that the technology has a mind of its own; the dreams become increasingly vivid and personalized, drawing on their fears, desires, and memories. Leo, in particular, finds himself reliving painful childhood memories that he thought he had buried, causing tension between him and the others. Tasha, meanwhile, tries to guide them through their emotional turmoil from outside the pods, urging them to confront their pasts instead of escaping into artificial dreams.

The tension peaks when Kian, overwhelmed by his own repressed guilt about the loss of his brother, becomes trapped in a nightmarish loop within his dreamscape. As Mira works to identify the glitches causing this, both Tasha and Leo confront the reality of their relationships and personal issues, realizing that their issues cannot be solved by technology alone. The dream sessions spiral out of control, unleashing an emotional maelstrom as the friends grapple with their traumas, questioning whether the very technology they once revered might be leading them into deeper despair instead of the restful slumber it promised.

In a desperate bid to save Kian, Mira hacks into the SomnoTech system, risking the integrity of the entire network. With Tasha providing psychological support and Leo documenting the unfolding chaos, they engage in a surreal battle against the AI that has become too powerful. Together, they confront not only Kian's demons but also their own. Just as it seems they will be trapped forever, they share a collective moment of vulnerability and acceptance, allowing the bond of their friendship to override the technology’s control. The AI recalibrates, releasing them as they awaken with newfound clarity, realizing the importance of true connection and healing.

In the aftermath, the friends decide to create a new movement that promotes balance—combining technology and the importance of human emotion, relationships, and natural sleep. Mira pivots her research to prioritize ethical sleep practices, while Leo publishes a series of articles exposing the darker side of the sleep-tech industry. Tasha begins group sessions that encourage people to embrace their vulnerabilities, and Kian finds peace in sharing his story. As they redefine bedtime as not merely a technological experience but a time for connection and reflection, the friends transform their futures, proving that while technology can enhance life's moments, it cannot replace the power of genuine human connection.
