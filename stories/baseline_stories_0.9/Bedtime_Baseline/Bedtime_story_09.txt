In the year 2045, society has embraced a radical transformation in its understanding of sleep and rest. People no longer adhere to conventional sleep patterns; instead, sleep pods have become the norm, encapsulating users in advanced environments that monitor and optimize individual sleep needs. Among the residents of New Haven, a bustling city dominated by neon lights and towering skyscrapers, four friends navigate this brave new world. Lyra, a sleep therapist, works with clients to improve their sleep experiences. Jax, a tech-savvy entrepreneur, has created a startup that integrates dream-sharing technology into the pods. Clara, a nurse, is concerned about the increasing number of patients suffering from sleep disorders. Lastly, Thom, a skeptic who refuses to use the pods, believes true rest is disappearing from humanity’s grasp.

As bedtime approaches each night, the four friends gather in Clara’s apartment to discuss the implications of their technologically-enhanced lives. Lyra shares her experiences with clients whose lives have been transformed by dream sharing, where they can connect and explore each other's dreams while lying in their pods. Jax showcases his latest invention: a device that enhances the sensory feedback in the sleep pods, allowing users to feel their dreams as vividly as reality. Clara expresses her worry about the rise of sleep-related health issues, pointing out that the technology is leaving many disconnected from their natural sleep cycles. Thom argues passionately against the changes, claiming that the magic of dreaming is being lost to a corporate machine that commodifies rest.

As their discussions continue, a new prototype of the sleep pod is announced, designed to induce a deeper sleep state through neuro-stimulation. The friends decide to test it together, but as they lie down in the pods, they discover that the system has a hidden function: it can manipulate memories and dreams beyond their expectations. While Jax attempts to steer their experience toward shared dreams, the technology malfunctions, throwing each of them into their most profound fears and insecurities. Lyra finds herself in a nightmare landscape of her client’s hidden traumas, Clara faces a past patient who haunts her guilt, Jax's dreams become a nightmarish vision of his failed startup, and Thom is trapped in an endless loop of a life without connection.

In the chaotic dreamscape, the friends struggle to reunite and escape the grip of their subconscious fears. The bonds they formed in reality begin to fracture under the weight of their individual struggles. However, as they confront their fears together, they realize they can support one another even in this surreal realm. By sharing affirmations of their strengths, they begin to dismantle the negative constructs that have formed in their minds, learning that camaraderie is a powerful force even in the darkest dreams. The narrative reaches a boiling point as they join their collective will to break free, shattering the oppressive confines of the malfunctioning pod.

Emerging from the pod, disoriented but alive, the four friends are forever changed by their experience. They reflect on the lessons learned from their shared ordeal, realizing the importance of genuine connection and the need to honor the natural rhythms of their lives. Clara vows to advocate for a balanced approach to technology and rest, while Jax rethinks his vision for dream-sharing. Lyra begins to incorporate mindfulness practices into her sessions, and Thom finally agrees to try a pod, deciding to embrace the future while retaining a grasp on reality. As they look to the stars from Clara's balcony, they understand that true bedtime is not just about the hours spent asleep, but about the relationships and experiences that fill their waking lives.
