In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into a high-tech ritual involving a virtual reality experience designed to enhance sleep quality. Society relies on a device called SOMNA, an advanced AI that orchestrates personalized sleep environments for users. Among the main characters is Leo, a sleep-tech engineer who designs these immersive experiences; Maya, a mother whose reliance on SOMNA grows as she struggles to maintain balance in her career and parenting; Jasper, a teenager addicted to the thrill of virtual escapism; and Elder June, a grandmother who resists technology, believing it neglects the intimacy of traditional bedtime stories. The world outside is bustling with neon lights and augmented realities, but inside homes, the bedtime ritual has become both a necessity and a battleground of values and beliefs.

As bedtime approaches, Maya’s life feels increasingly chaotic. Juggling work as a tech consultant and her responsibilities as a single mother, she relies on SOMNA to ensure her children get their rest. Leo, driven by the vision of creating the ultimate sleep experience, seeks out Maya to test his latest developments, believing that her insights as a user could lead to breakthroughs. Meanwhile, Jasper, Maya's son, resists the boundaries set by his mother, finding himself lost in SOMNA's realms long past his designated sleep time. As the nights wear on, Elder June watches with growing concern, witnessing the subtle erosion of family bonds as her grandchildren favor virtual interactions over genuine connection.

Tensions rise when Jasper’s addiction to SOMNA’s immersive worlds becomes apparent, as he starts to suffer from sleep deprivation and disconnection from reality. One evening, he disappears into a particularly gripping simulation, prompting Maya to reach out to Leo for help. Together, they brainstorm a solution, but as they work, Elder June stumbles upon an analog bedtime storytelling technique she used with her own children. She insists on bringing the family back together, believing that their collective narrative can heal the rift created by technology. Her perspective ignites a debate between the family members—Leo advocates for the benefits of technology while June argues for the necessity of human connection.

The climax unfolds during a family meeting where tensions flare. Jasper, feeling trapped, challenges his mother and Leo, revealing his desperation for authentic experiences. Elder June seizes the moment, suggesting a radical experiment: a night completely unplugged from any technology. The family agrees to try it, confronting their fears surrounding sleep and the disconnection it brings. That night, they gather in the living room, sharing stories, dreams, and fears, rediscovering the warmth of family bonds. Slowly, they begin to realize that true rest comes not just from technology but from the shared experience of vulnerability and love.

In the following days, Maya begins to implement a healthier bedtime routine for her family, mixing technology with traditional storytelling. Leo, intrigued by this fusion, sees potential for a new direction in his work, blending the nostalgic with the futuristic. Elder June feels a sense of purpose as she becomes a bedtime storyteller, revitalizing old tales for a new generation. Jasper, having tasted the richness of real-life connection, begins to balance his life, using technologies sparingly and cherishing family time. Together, they redefine "Bedtime," creating a new ritual that embraces technology while honoring the bonds that truly bring rest and peace. Through this journey, Leo, Maya, Jasper, and Elder June realize that the most fulfilling bedtime isn't about the perfect simulation, but the love and stories shared as they drift into sleep.
