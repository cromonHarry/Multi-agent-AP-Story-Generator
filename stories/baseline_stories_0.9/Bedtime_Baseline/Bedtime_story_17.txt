In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed dramatically, influenced by advances in neurotechnology and societal shifts. In the city of Neoterica, where skyscrapers are interwoven with bioluminescent flora, children no longer transition to sleep without virtual companions. Families are equipped with the Dreamwave, a device that creates immersive dreams tailored to each individual’s fantasies. Ava, a ten-year-old girl, interacts with her vibrant virtual pet, Spark, who helps her navigate her dreamworld. Her father, Marcus, works as a Dream Engineer, crafting the digital narratives that populate these dreams, while her mother, Eliana, advocates for a return to organic bedtime rituals, emphasizing the value of human connection over technological immersion. Amidst this dynamic, a growing movement questions the merits of Dreamwave, highlighting the psychological effects of virtual escapism on childhood development.

As the Dreamwave becomes a staple of every household, the charm of traditional bedtime routines fades. Ava, enchanted by her nightly adventures with Spark, becomes increasingly detached from her reality, thriving in a world that feels safer and more magical than her own. Eliana, noticing Ava's withdrawal and the increasing emotional distance between families, begins organizing community meetings to discuss the implications of over-reliance on technology. The discourse draws the attention of Ethan, a teenage coder who has started to build a rogue app that challenges the Dreamwave’s influence by encouraging real-life experiences and genuine interactions. Inspired by Eliana’s passion, Ethan joins forces with her, while Marcus, torn between his career and the welfare of his daughter, grapples with the ethical implications of his work.

Tensions rise when Ava, after a particularly intense Dreamwave session, begins to experience terrifying nightmares that bleeds into her waking life. The boundary between her virtual and real worlds starts to erode, leaving her disoriented. During a community meeting, Eliana presents the alarming increase in children reporting sleep disturbances linked to their Dreamwave experiences. Marcus feels cornered as his professional integrity clashes with his responsibility as a father. Ethan proposes a daring solution: an experimental "Unplugged Night" where families disconnect from all technology, including the Dreamwave, committing to rediscover authentic connections with each other—and themselves. 

On Unplugged Night, the community gathers in their homes, facing the unfamiliar void left by the absence of digital entertainment. Foreshadowing the resistance from the younger generation, some children initially resist the idea, but as the evening progresses, they engage in storytelling, board games, and imaginative play. The awakening of camaraderie rekindles a sense of joy and belonging that many have forgotten. Ava, encouraged by the genuine laughter of her parents and neighbors, finds comfort in recognizing faces without the filter of virtuality. The night culminates with a poignant moment when Eliana shares a bedtime story that sparks Ava's imagination more than any dream ever could.

As dawn breaks, the community reflects on the transformative power of the night, but the decision remains whether to fully abandon the Dreamwave or integrate it into more balanced lives. Ava, feeling the warmth of her family and community, chooses to engage with her dreams on her terms, seeking to reconcile her digital adventures with real-life connections. Marcus decides to redesign his Dream Engineering practices to promote shared experiences rather than solitary escapism, while Eliana continues to champion the importance of mindfulness and interaction in childhood development. Ethan’s app gains traction as a grassroots movement, intertwining technology with reality to enhance, rather than replace, the beauty of bedtime stories. In this new world, as bedtime evolves, it becomes a bridge to authentic relationships rather than an escape from them.
