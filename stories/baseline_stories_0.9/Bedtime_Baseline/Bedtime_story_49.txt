In the year 2045, society has evolved into a hyper-connected digital realm where physical interaction has reached an all-time low. People of all ages rely on SleepSync technology, a neural interface that connects them to a virtual dreamscape, allowing for personalized dream experiences tailored to their desires and fears. The world has abandoned traditional bedtime rituals; instead, families send their loved ones off to sleep via an app, generating dreams that range from calming landscapes to thrilling adventures. Four main characters navigate this new reality: Leo, a young boy struggling to let go of his twilight fantasies; his mother, Rhea, a tech-savvy sleep designer; his father, Sam, a relic of the past who despises the technology; and Amara, an engineer who generates the coding for the dreams.

As Leo prepares for sleep one night, he experiences nightmares about being trapped in a dark, incomplete dream. Rhea, eager to help, decides to create a unique dream for him, incorporating elements from his favorite bedtime stories. However, as she inputs the dream parameters into the SleepSync system, she notices strange anomalies occurring in the code. Meanwhile, Sam remains skeptical about the technology’s effect on their son, insisting that Leo should embrace real-life adventures rather than virtual ones. This leads to tension within the family as Rhea believes she is offering her son an enriching experience, while Sam fears the potential consequences of losing touch with reality altogether.

Late at night, as the SleepSync system activates and Leo enters his dream, something goes horribly wrong. A glitch in the system traps him in a nightmarish world devoid of escape, where he confronts dark versions of himself. Rhea and Sam are alerted when the dream becomes unstable; the system starts feeding on Leo's fears. In a race against time, Rhea and Sam must work together, utilizing both her technological expertise and his understanding of childhood fears. They contact Amara, who realizes that Leo’s dream has become a breeding ground for a rogue code left by a discontented employee at SleepSync, intent on sabotaging the system.

The climax unfolds as Rhea, Sam, and Amara frantically navigate the maze of Leo's dreamscape, where each turn reveals manifestations of his anxieties. They confront the rogue code, battling it with a combination of emotional ties and tech-savviness. As they push through to reach Leo, Rhea recognizes that she must confront her own fears of inadequacy as a mother, while Sam learns to adapt to the ever-changing world. Their unity gives them the strength to break the loop and free Leo from the clutches of his nightmares.

In the aftermath, Leo awakens safely, but the experience leaves the family forever changed. Rhea decides not to rely solely on the SleepSync system, choosing to incorporate elements of traditional bedtime routines, such as storytelling and warm embraces, into their lives. Sam becomes more open-minded, learning to balance the use of technology with real-world experiences for Leo. The family ultimately finds a way to coexist in their futuristic world while prioritizing the emotional and psychological well-being of their son. As they gather for bedtime once more, they embrace a new understanding of what it means to prepare for sleep in a world where dreams are both a gift and a potential trap.
