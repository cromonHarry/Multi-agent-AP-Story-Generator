In the year 2045, bedtime has become a complex ritual governed by advanced technology and societal norms. In this world, sleep is no longer just a period of rest; it is a commodified experience. "Dreamscapes," virtual reality environments tailored to individual desires, dominate the marketplace, and families are required to secure sleep credits to access them. Among those navigating this landscape are Lila, a tech-savvy young girl who has grown disillusioned with the artificiality of her manufactured dreams; her father Ben, a sleep engineer struggling to maintain his family’s quality of life amidst the relentless demands of their corporate overlords; her mother Mira, a therapist advocating for natural sleep solutions; and Jonah, Lila's best friend, an optimist who believes in the beauty of shared dreaming experiences.

As bedtime approaches, Lila rebels against the enforced dreamscape that her parents have arranged for her. She craves authenticity and longs for the lost art of storytelling—a simple bedtime ritual of imagination that has nearly vanished. Ben, overwhelmed by work and financial pressures, is unable to see the strain it places on Lila. Mira, torn between encouraging her daughter’s desires and supporting her husband's job, begins exploring experimental methods to help Lila experience sleep without digital enhancements. Meanwhile, Jonah, ever the enthusiastic supporter, introduces Lila to underground gatherings where children share stories and tales, igniting her passion for creativity and natural dreaming.

The tension reaches its peak when Lila decides to skip her scheduled dream session to join Jonah at one of the gatherings. Attending this event awakens her dormant imagination, and she discovers a community of young rebels fighting to reclaim the essence of bedtime stories. However, the gathering is interrupted by corporate enforcers tasked with policing unauthorized sleep experiences. Lila and Jonah narrowly escape, but the encounter forces Lila to confront her fears about the loss of her childhood and the pressure of parental expectations. With her family's future threatened by the corporation’s tightening grip, Lila realizes she must act to save her world from this fabricated reality.

In the aftermath of their escape, Lila’s defiance begins to rally support among her peers. Inspired by a newfound sense of purpose, she convinces Mira to join her in creating a grassroots movement that promotes natural sleep through storytelling, advocating for a return to authentic bedtime rituals. Ben, initially resistant, sees the profound impact this movement has on his daughter and the community, leading him to question the values that have dictated his work in the sleep industry. Together, they organize an event at their local community center, inviting families to share stories and rediscover the warmth of bedtime together.

As the movement gains momentum, Lila learns that bedtime is not solely about sleep but about connection, imagination, and the bonds formed through shared experiences. The culmination of their efforts results in a city-wide initiative that redefines bedtime as a sacred time for families and friends to come together. Lila, Jonah, Mira, and Ben find themselves at the forefront of a cultural revolution, ultimately reshaping the mythology of dreams as soft, gentle, and real. They remind everyone that even in a technologically advanced world, the simplest moments shared at bedtime can be the most powerful of all.
