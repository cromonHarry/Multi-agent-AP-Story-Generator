In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into a high-tech ritual, where sleep is no longer a natural state but a programmable experience. Citizens of Neo-Tokyo rely on Sleep Pods—biometric chambers that customize sleep cycles through neural algorithms. Mara, a sleep technician, tinkers with the latest AI Sleep Enhancer, aiming to achieve the perfect sleep formula. Her best friend, Kaito, is a sleep advocate who believes in natural rest, often challenging Mara’s reliance on technology. They frequently debate the implications of a society where intimacy has been replaced by quantified measures of rest, making sleep an advertisement-driven commodity. Meanwhile, Sora, a young girl whose parents are consumed by their relentless work schedules, begins to suffer from sleep deprivation amid the cacophony of tech-driven bedtime routines. A suspicious figure, Raiden, a rogue hacker, believes there is a darker truth behind the Sleep Pods, initiating a quest that will intertwine their lives.

Mara’s meticulous adjustments to the Sleep Enhancer yield promising results, capturing the attention of the corporate giants who market the Sleep Pods. Kaito, concerned about the community’s growing dependency on these devices, urges Mara to reconsider her work. Torn between her career ambitions and her friendship with Kaito, Mara starts noticing that the Sleep Pods seem to monitor users’ emotional states, presenting unnerving behavioral data. One night, Sora, overwhelmed by digital noise and the hollowness of her family’s nightly routines, stumbles into Mara's workshop. She reveals her nightmares, displaying vivid dreams that seem too real and interconnected with the Sleep Pods' operations. Intrigued, Mara realizes that Sora’s dreams could involve the error patterns within the Sleep Enhancer, hinting at a malfunction that may play into Raiden’s fears about the tech’s ulterior motives.

As Mara's investigation unfolds, she and Kaito uncover a conspiracy orchestrated by the corporation that manufactures the Sleep Pods. They learn that the devices not only influence sleep patterns but also manipulate user memories and emotions to enforce compliance and productivity. Armed with this knowledge, they join forces with Sora and Raiden, who possess valuable hacking skills. Together, they infiltrate the corporate headquarters to expose the truth within the system. However, their presence triggers an alarm, leading to a chaotic chase through the labyrinth of the building. It becomes a race against time as their lives hang in the balance, and they grapple with their dependency on technology that has altered their very humanity.

During their escape, Sora’s ability to navigate the Sleep Pods' neural network proves invaluable, allowing them to access the mainframe and reveal the hidden data. As the group confronts the CEO in a final showdown, they realize that their individual fears and desires have been manipulated by the very technology they sought to liberate themselves from. In a moment of clarity, Mara offers a countermeasure—an open-source blueprint for a new version of the Sleep Pod that prioritizes mental and emotional well-being over profit. The group’s conviction ignites a movement that challenges the corporation's hold on society, leading to a public outcry for better sleep technology and practices.

In the aftermath, Neo-Tokyo begins to embrace a new approach to sleep, blending the benefits of technology with the essence of natural routines. Mara and Kaito find renewed purpose in guiding the community towards healthier practices, while Sora becomes a voice for children grappling with the pressures of the digital age. Raiden, once a rogue, becomes a hero for the resistance against corporate control. Though the journey has left scars, the group emerges stronger, redefining “Bedtime” not as a programmed event but as a sacred moment of reflection, intimacy, and genuine rest, reclaiming their humanity in a world that had almost forgotten it.
