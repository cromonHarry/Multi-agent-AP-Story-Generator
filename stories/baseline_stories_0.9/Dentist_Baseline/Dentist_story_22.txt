In the year 2045, dental care has become a cutting-edge science, merging biotechnology with artificial intelligence. The world’s leading dental clinic, BioSmile, has developed a revolutionary treatment called “NeoDentistry,” which not only repairs teeth but enhances them with bioengineered materials. At the forefront of this clinic is Dr. Alana Wei, a brilliant but ethically conflicted dentist who struggles with the implications of her work. Her assistant, Jonah, a charming biohacker with a penchant for manipulating the latest tech, serves as her moral compass. Meanwhile, Ava, a ten-year-old girl with a genetic predisposition to severe dental issues, enters the clinic, accompanied by her skeptical father, Malik, who believes in traditional medicine and fears the consequences of this new technology.

As Alana prepares for Ava's augmented dental procedure, she unravels the complexities of NeoDentistry—its ability to not only repair but permanently alter a patient’s dental structure for enhanced health and beauty. This innovation has attracted both zealous supporters and fierce critics, leading to ethical debates about bodily autonomy and the pursuit of perfection. Ava's father, Malik, expresses his concerns, questioning the implications of altering a child’s natural form. Alana finds herself torn between her desire to help Ava and her growing unease about the potential repercussions of her work, especially after witnessing a case where a patient experienced unexpected side effects.

The tension culminates when Alana discovers that a select group of patients, including Ava, have been used in experimental trials without proper consent, raising alarms regarding the ethics of the BioSmile corporation. Disturbed by this revelation, she confronts her bosses, who downplay her concerns as merely collateral damage in the pursuit of progress. With Jonah’s assistance, Alana devises a plan to expose the truth behind the clinic’s practices, but timing is critical, as Ava's procedure is scheduled for the next day, and the child’s health hangs in the balance.

In a daring attempt to sabotage the procedure, Alana and Jonah make their way into the clinic's private archives, uncovering not only the unethical practices but also evidence of a cover-up involving prominent state officials. As alarms blare, and security sweeps through the facility, they have mere minutes to rescue Ava before the procedure begins. Malik, who initially distrusts Alana, joins forces with her, breaking through the fears of modern medicine to protect his daughter from the looming threat of irreversible alteration.

Ultimately, their efforts yield success, as they manage to halt Ava's procedure just in time, exposing BioSmile’s unethical practices to the public. In the aftermath, Alana is hailed as a whistleblower, gaining a newfound sense of purpose and responsibility to advocate for ethical dental practices in an age of rapid technological advancement. Malik begins to reconcile his views, understanding that while the future holds potential for positive change, it must be harnessed with caution. With Ava’s natural smile preserved, the group reflects on the importance of balance between innovation and morality, ensuring that the evolution of dentistry aligns with the humanity of those it serves.
