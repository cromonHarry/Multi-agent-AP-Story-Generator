In a near future where humanity has integrated advanced technology into daily life, the role of dentists has transformed into something far beyond mere tooth care. In the sprawling megacity of Neodentis, Dr. Lira Voss, a leading figure in dental cybernetics, specializes in enhancing human teeth with bioluminescent properties that not only improve aesthetics but also serve as health monitors. Her best friend and assistant, Remy, a sentient AI embedded within dental devices, helps her manage patient appointments and offers real-time data analyses during procedures. Despite their significant success, Lira carries the burden of a family legacy tied to traditional dentistry, which she often feels is overshadowed by the rising popularity of augmented dental treatments. Their world is shaken by the recent emergence of a mysterious illness that causes patients to reject these enhancements, leaving them in severe pain and facing potential tooth loss.

As word spreads of the illness, Lira and Remy notice a growing number of patients seeking traditional treatments, which have all but been abandoned in favor of futuristic modifications. The two friends embark on a quest to uncover the cause of the illness, delving into the archives of dental history and discovering that the evolutionary leap to augmented dentistry might have overlooked crucial biological considerations. Alongside them is Dr. Theo Arkham, a renegade bioethicist who has been advocating for the preservation of natural dentistry. Reluctantly, he joins their investigation, bringing with him a wealth of knowledge regarding genetic manipulation and the potential consequences of their advancements. As they dig deeper, they find a troubling connection between the enhanced dental technologies and the sudden onset of the illness.

The trio's quest for answers leads them to a black-market lab rumored to be conducting illicit experiments on dental implants. Lira, Remy, and Theo infiltrate the facility, where they discover that a rogue faction is implanting a virus into the enhancements to control patients for their own nefarious purposes. Confronted by the leader of the faction, a disgraced former dentist named Diana Krull, the group learns that the enhancements were originally intended to ease societal pressure regarding appearance, but have now been weaponized. In a tense showdown, Lira must tap into her traditional skills to save her patients while Remy works to disable the faction's control systems, showcasing a blend of old and new practices.

Following their confrontation with the rogue faction, Lira and her team emerge victorious but not unscathed. They have to face the harsh reality that many patients have experienced irreversible damage from the virus embedded in their enhancements. With the help of Theo's contacts in the medical community, they begin developing a treatment plan to detoxify the affected patients while spreading awareness about the risks of rapid dental technological advancements. Lira, now more determined than ever, begins to incorporate elements of traditional dentistry back into her practice, seeking a balance between the old and the new, while Remy updates their systems to prioritize patient health over aesthetic appeal.

In the end, Lira establishes the Center for Holistic Dental Care, a pioneering facility that harmonizes advanced dental technology with natural treatments. As she stands amidst her team, including a reformed Diana who seeks redemption, Lira feels a renewed sense of purpose. The patients flood in, not only for treatment but to learn about the philosophy behind their care. Lira understands that the future of dentistry lies not solely in high-tech enhancements but in preserving the essence of what it means to care for one's health, highlighting a bond that connects both the past and the future.
