As the inaugural match of the CyberCup approaches, tension escalates between emotional analytics and the players' human instincts. Luca, struggling with the weight of real-time performance metrics, receives an unexpected invitation from Iris to test her new neuro-enhancement suit—designed to synchronize player emotions with fans in the stands.
