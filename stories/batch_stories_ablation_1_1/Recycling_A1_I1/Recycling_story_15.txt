In the bustling metropolis of Neo-Eden, where concrete intermingles with vibrant green biotic life, Eira Kincaid, a dedicated Ecosystem Custodian, educates communities about the symbiotic relationships between themselves and the living materials around them. Her passion is reflected in the flourishing urban gardens, replete with smart biopackaging that self-repairs and regenerates. Nearby, Lucian Torin, the Holo-Artist, captures the emotion of discarded materials through his interactive holograms, igniting conversations around stewardship. As they navigate this world, they cross paths with Zara Relin, the innovative bioengineer, and Milo Ravinthorn, the community organizer, whose collective vision champions a lifestyle that nurtures both people and their newly defined living resources.

As tensions escalate in Neo-Eden, Eira discovers a covert initiative threatening to unleash synthetic materials that disrupt the ecological balance. During a community gathering organized by Milo, she reveals her findings, igniting a heated debate among the citizens about the risks of commodifying the very materials they cherish.
