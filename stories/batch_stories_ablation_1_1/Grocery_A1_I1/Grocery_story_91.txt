In the vibrant heart of 2150, amidst the bustling atmosphere of a Flavor Hub, Sophie Han, a holographic chef, deftly navigates her kitchen space, sharing her grandmother’s cherished recipes with an eager group of diverse patrons. Laughter and the scent of herbs fill the air as Khalil Marks, the urban micro-farmer, passionately guides local youth in harvesting micro-vegetables, inspiring them to embrace their cultural roots.
