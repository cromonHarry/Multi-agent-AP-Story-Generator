As guests taste the dish, the synesthetic stovetop erupts in a vibrant display of colors, reflecting collective joy and nostalgia, sparking an unexpected emotional dialogue among attendees. However, as Ravi's protests escalate, a heated argument ignites, pitting tradition against innovation.

As the collaboration between Zara, Tara, Elias, and Ravi blossoms, they launch a series of workshops that intertwine traditional cooking methods with AI innovations.
