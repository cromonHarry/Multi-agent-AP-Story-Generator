In a corner office, Dr. Kieran Eldridge scrutinizes the ethical implications of the Dream Concords' protocols, grappling with the fragile balance between individuality and growing collective consciousness, as society stands on the precipice of a new era of interconnected identities.

As the DreamFusion Gathering commences, Lira unveils her latest immersive dreamscape, a simulation that invites participants to confront their collective societal traumas. However, the experience takes a harrowing turn when unexpected psychic feedback jolts through the DreamSync Pods, causing emotional discord among the dreamers.
