The blurred lines between personal and communal consciousness reach a tipping point, compelling the Dream Governance Network to vote on urgent new regulations, forcing each character to confront their motivations and fears amid a collective awakening.

Following the tumultuous climax, the Dream Governance Network's unexpected vote ends in favor of stricter regulations on dream data usage, compelling DreamCore to reassess its practices.
