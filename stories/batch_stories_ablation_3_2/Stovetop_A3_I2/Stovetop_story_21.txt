In the bustling, neon-streaked city of Transcendence, the air shimmers with the aroma of spices and the electric pulse of competition. Juno Kael, a visionary revolutionary chef, gathers with like-minded culinaries in a clandestine 'Taste Pod', where black-market energy supplies flicker to life under the dim glow of quantum stovetops. The walls resonate with whispers of oppressed communities and the clashing of metal pots, embodying the struggle for access to culinary arts. Meanwhile, Kaida Lin, tucked inside her Culinary Cloud lab, designs AI-infused recipes that aim to bridge food and community.
