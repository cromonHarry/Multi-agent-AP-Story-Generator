As laughter, warmth, and brewing coffee fill the air, the community unknowingly stands on the brink of a profound existential reckoning, setting the stage for the Neuro-Coffee Revolution to unfold.

Aria introduces a new neuro-coffee blend that unexpectedly evokes overwhelming sadness, stirring buried memories in its patrons. While some revel in the shared catharsis, others—led by Liam—voice alarm over the lack of consent and awareness of emotional implications. Juno, inspired, plans a showcase blending art and shared pain, while Zara rushes to create an exhibit highlighting these ethical concerns. The café becomes a battleground for conflicting ideologies, challenging the societal fabric woven by shared experiences, raising questions about identity and emotional integrity.
