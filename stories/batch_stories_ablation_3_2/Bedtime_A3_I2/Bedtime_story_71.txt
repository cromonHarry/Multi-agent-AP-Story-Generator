As the Sleep Ceremony unfolds, a sudden system-wide glitch jolts the DreamPods, creating an unnerving amalgamation of participants' subconscious threads. Elara struggles to maintain the intended intimacy, witnessing friendships and rivalries form and dissolve in the swirling chaos of collective dreaming.

Harnessing her skills as a Dream Architect, she initiates a synchronized 'Dream Weaving' among the participants, engaging their innate creativity to create a shared narrative that binds their identities while nurturing individuality.
