Nearby, Talon Voss cheers on the budding entrepreneurs, each eager to unlock the transformative potential of the dream trade. Together, these characters navigate the blurred lines of reality and dreams, seeking a harmonious balance amid technological advancement and existential questioning.

As Mara's Soulweaving Session ignites emotions in the Dream Sanctuary, a sudden glitch in the Dream Neuralink Capsules disrupts the experience, plunging participants into chaotic and fragmented realities.
