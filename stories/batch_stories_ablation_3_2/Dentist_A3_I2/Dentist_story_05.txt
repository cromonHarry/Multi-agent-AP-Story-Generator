Among the crowd, Dr. Liora Synth navigates the thrumming energy of a decentralized bio-hub, passionately advocating for an ethical approach to the society's obsession with dental perfection. Nearby, Kai Marsden discreetly offers memory-alteration services, grappling with the consequences of commodifying identity through the pain and pleasure of altered memories. Seraphina Bell stands at the forefront of a vibrant rally celebrating natural smiles, challenging the status quo. As Felix Orion orchestrates a corporate campaign to cement bioengineering as the gold standard for dental aesthetics, tensions heighten, revealing the sharp divide between the elites pursuing perfection and the grassroots movements embracing authentic imperfection.

As the annual 'Smile Gala' approaches, where the elites display their biogenetically engineered smiles, tension escalates when Seraphina's grassroots movement organizes a counter-event dubbed 'Raw Rebellion.' Dr. Liora Synth is drawn into the fray, publically supporting Seraphina while attempting to sway people's perceptions of dental aesthetics.
