In the year 2145, society stands at a crossroads between authenticity and augmentation, as dental identity becomes a symbol of personal and social status. Dr. Livia Tane, a devoted advocate for natural smile rights, navigates her bustling clinic, its walls adorned with the scars of ethical debates regarding commodified health. As she treats patients yearning for unenhanced authenticity, her path intertwines with Zara Kade, the charismatic Augmentist activist, who passionately rallies for the equality that bioware brings. Meanwhile, Felix Aris, a tech innovator, experiences cognitive dissonance as he bears witness to the cultural rift, while Mae Talamante captures the complex narratives, aiming to unify the polarized communities through her lens in a world both enchanted and troubled by their respective choices.

Tensions escalate as Dr. Livia Tane organizes a community forum to advocate for natural smile rights, inadvertently drawing the ire of Zara Kade, who sees it as a direct challenge to the Augmentist movement. During the forum, members of both factions confront each other passionately, leading to heated debates about identity, consent, and the moral implications of dental bioware. Felix Aris arrives, struggling to defend his innovations while feeling the weight of the discord they have caused. Meanwhile, Mae Talamante captures the raw emotions on film, recognizing the impending clash that could either bridge the divide or plunge society into chaos.
