In the year 2147, society teeters on the brink of transformation as the rift between the 'Elite Smilers' and 'Natural Gnashers' deepens. Within this world, Dr. Livia Trent advocates for ethical genetic enhancements, seeking to bridge the divide and navigate the complexities of 'Oral Sovereignty.' Meanwhile, Kai Iskander rallies the Natural Gnashers to uphold the beauty of organic identity against societal pressure. Rhea Tolland creates provocative art to spark dialogues on body ownership amidst the rising influence of technocrat Ethan Voight, who dreams of revolutionizing oral health with groundbreaking technology. Their paths converge in a society grappling with identity, consent, and the ever-evolving definitions of beauty.

As tensions escalate, Dr. Livia Trent organizes a symposium entitled 'Voices of Oral Identity' to foster dialogue between Elite Smilers and Natural Gnashers. However, during the event, a protest led by Kai Iskander erupts, condemning the elitism entrenched in dental enhancements. Amidst the chaos, Rhea Tolland showcases her latest installation, depicting the consequences of forced beauty standards. Ethan Voight attempts to undermine Kai's influence by unveiling a prototype of the Autonomous Oral Regrowth System, promising a future where both identities can coexist. The conflicting ideologies clash, revealing deep-seated fears about loss of autonomy and the nature of beauty in their society.

As the symposium reaches its boiling point, Dr. Livia Trent steps into the fray, pleading for unity amidst the chaos. However, tensions escalate when Kai Iskander directly confronts Ethan Voight, accusing him of commodifying oral identity for profit. Rhea Tolland’s installation, depicting the violent implications of enforced beauty standards, ignites a public outrage, fracturing the audience into factions. As protestors clash with technocrats, Dr. Trent devises a bold plan to propose a new 'Oral Identity Accord', inviting both sides to co-create a future that celebrates diversity in dental identity. The climax challenges characters to choose between preservation and innovation, revealing their true allegiances.

In the aftermath of the chaotic symposium, Dr. Livia Trent rallies both factions for a crucial meeting to discuss the proposed Oral Identity Accord. Kai Iskander, still reeling from the confrontation, reluctantly agrees to participate, recognizing the potential for reconciliation. Rhea Tolland uses her art to create a powerful mural that symbolizes unity between the two groups, drawing attention to the beauty in diversity. Meanwhile, Ethan Voight contemplates his role as a technocrat, realizing that his innovations could bridge the gap rather than widen it. Together, they begin to draft a shared vision, paving the way for a new societal framework that honors both enhanced and natural identities.

In the final resolution, the Oral Identity Accord is ratified, symbolizing a new era of coexistence between Elite Smilers and Natural Gnashers. Dr. Livia Trent becomes a mediator, facilitating ongoing dialogues that honor individual choice and collective understanding. Kai Iskander, inspired by Rhea's artwork, emerges as a leading voice for preservation within the newly formed Oral Health Council, advocating for ethical oversight in enhancements. Ethan Voight commits to transparently developing technology that uplifts rather than exploits identities. The community embraces the Dentalbiome Guilds, fostering a culture where all oral identities are celebrated, leading to a festival that highlights their diverse journeys and shared humanity.
