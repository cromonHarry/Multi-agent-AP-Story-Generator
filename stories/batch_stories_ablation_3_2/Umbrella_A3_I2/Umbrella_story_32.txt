With the storm raging outside, they initiate a massive collaborative art project, bioluminescent murals woven with collective memories, hopes, and fears, igniting a beacon of unity amidst the tempest. Seraphine, piloting through turbulent data streams, redirects the network's focus toward amplifying these communal expressions, while Jasper captures each moment. The Umbrella shifts from glitching chaos to dynamic harmony, crafting a resilient symphony of human connection, just as nature's tempest reaches its peak.
