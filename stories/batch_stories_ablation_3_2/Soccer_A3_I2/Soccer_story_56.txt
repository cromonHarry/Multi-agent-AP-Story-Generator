As the big match approaches, Lira Voss discovers that Kareem's Ethics jerseys are malfunctioning, showing incorrect environmental data and spawning confusion among fans. In the spirit of collaboration, Lira, Kareem, and Ava convene to troubleshoot the issue, realizing it stems from overwhelming external pressures from a traditionalist advocacy group resistant to technological integration.

The holographic displays pulsate with real-time data, showcasing their symbiotic bond and engaging the audience in a visceral experience of ecological consciousness. However, the traditionalists launch a disruptive campaign, momentarily overshadowing the match with chaos. In this pivotal moment, Lira rallies her teammates and fans, igniting a powerful chant that transforms the stadium into a vibrant, living organism, exemplifying how soccer can unite disparate elements for a common cause—a monumental stand against climate stagnation, reclaiming the narrative of the sport as a vehicle for revolutionary change.

As the chaos from the traditionalists subsides, Lira, Kareem, and Ava capitalize on the moment, channeling the collective fan energy into an impromptu demonstration of unity. Lira's purifying movements catalyze the stadium's living architecture, triggering a wave of color and light that visually communicates the importance of ecological stewardship.
