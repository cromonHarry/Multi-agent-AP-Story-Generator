With time running out, Isla and Vikram work hand-in-hand to deploy a last-minute update to Vikram's emotional security device, igniting hope in a world gripped by disillusionment and fear, while risking their identities for the greater good.

In the aftermath of the attack, the citizens of Neo-Unity emerge into a hesitant calm, grappling with the stark reality of their fragile interconnectedness. Isla Harrow, reinvigorated by their collective resilience, addresses a gathering, passionately advocating for the immediate implementation of 'conscious space rights' as she shares the harrowing stories from the identity theft crisis.
