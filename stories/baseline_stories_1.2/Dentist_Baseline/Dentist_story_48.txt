In the year 2145, the once-humble role of dentist has transformed into a multifaceted profession rich with technology and social implications. The story revolves around four main characters: Dr. Alina Greeves, a cutting-edge dental practitioner who specializes in regenerative tooth therapy; Brix, an AI companion who assists Alina with diagnostics and patient reminders; Thomas, a bitter patient who believes that dental biological implants are a sign of societal decay; and Lila, a young tech-savvy girl struggling with her anxiety about dental procedures.

Alina is on the verge of launching a bold campaign promoting natural tooth preservation, yet she's constantly challenged by public skepticism fueled by Justice Dentistry—a coalition led by Thomas. This group glories in the idea of embracing humanity’s flaws, unafraid of reverting to traditional methods and valid resistance upon seeing patients depend heavily on machines even for simple cleanings. Alina enlists Brix to anecdotes warning of potential contagions housed in outdated dental technologies and passionately reaches out to patients disenchanted with the dependency fostered by AI. Meanwhile, Lila’s overly guilt-ridden experience after struggling with dental drilling amplifies her impostor syndrome, gradually laying her trust toward the advancements instead.

The climax arises when Lila influences a local youth council to host an event where patients reconnect with roots and validity surrounding the debate: alterative dental installations shall be showcased, coinciding with traditional treatments championed by Thomas. Several campaign groups, including Justice Dentistry, want to turn Lila's corporate event into a neopolitical showdown spanning in-person diagnostics enlightenment exploiting Ultranets among curious locals. During the event, tempers flare as Alina engages in an unexpected showdown with Thomas onstage while Lila finds her digital documentation blowing up into chaos. Alina counters Thomas's defiance by revealing the bleak consequence of perpetuating fear with vulnerable personal stories from those who have suffered debilitating conditions post the crude dental machinery by neglecting prevention and repair.

As things spiral out of control, Lila takes a visceral stand, sharing the stinging details of her anxiety alongside a comedic twist implying that life difference could amass around failure – rooting in a fearless spirit that rejects the stigma tethered to struggles. A portal opens, with newfound voices running across the floor aligning both patients with surprise with relief, transcending former preferences thus guided into heartwarming discussions revealing disappointed hearts met with cultural shifts due to tech-or-bio. Alina, Thomas, and even Brix start to recognize that unity embracing their beliefs directly guarantees patient agency and returns authenticity forgotten while redefining future autonomy between patients and their dentition.
