Instead, fluoride nanobots measured against invasive procedures, administering real-time tooth care and repair.

Her staff included Giovanni Desai, an imaginative surgical engineer responsible for the design of new nanos in oral care, and Tessa Brinks, a dermal therapist skilled in pain-free transitions from traditional treatments to the world of full-pocket healthtrack-ups. However, lurking in the shadows of this dental utopia is Clyde Welles, a disgruntled former dental hygienist turned bioterrorist, who has harbored resentment towards an unregistered consumer-grade technology promising dental whitening without side effects but packed with nefarious entities.
