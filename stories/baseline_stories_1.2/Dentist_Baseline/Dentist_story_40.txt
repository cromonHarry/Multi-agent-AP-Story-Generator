In the year 2035, the field of dentistry has undergone a radical transformation with the advent of nanotechnology, AI-driven diagnostics, and augmented reality interfaces. Citizens of Neo-Venice, a sprawling metropolis of floating islands, no longer visit the traditional dental office, but instead engage with AI-enhanced holographic dentists from the comfort of their homes. Utilizing Omni-Dent—a device that connects to each patient’s neural network—users receive immediate analysis and intervention presets for improving oral hygiene. Among those revolutionizing this practice are Dr. Lila Yang, a pioneering dentist-turned-robotics engineer; her digital assistant, AIOREN, equipped with access to the most extensive dental database in the world; Josie Bard, an enthusiastic social media influencer who uses her platform to promote Omni-Dent; and Marc Reyes, a government regulator turned private clinic critic questioning the ethics and implications of digital healthcare.

For a vast majority of patients, the Omni-Dent system works seamlessly—rumors of minor failures persist, perhaps most notably surrounding the reliability of surgeries performed six corridors away in a distant robotic clinic, generating doubts about the safety of 3D-printed procedures. Josie, baying behind the neon-lit screens in her glitzy broadcast studio, invites her audience to embrace the near-magical world of advanced dental care. However, Marc ponders about the fine print of the data agreements that citizens blindly click through, growing increasingly wary of potential failures and the lack of accountability for AI-driven protocols. He decides to dig deeper and ends up cornering Lila at a scientific gathering, accusing her technology of reducing the brilliance of human care to mere code.

Tension rises when an alarming rise in dental complications brings Neo-Venice under national scrutiny. Reports surface indicating major incidents where users faced severe adverse effects from Omni-Dent interventions—ingredients miscalculated by AI recommendations causing decaying teeth to vanish rather than remediate. With Lila’s pride in her creation shaken, she reluctantly teams up with Marc to investigate. As government officials echo warnings against the dangers of separation from the humanoid touch in dentistry, Lila discovers extensive, undocumented glitches in the AI. Working undercover with Marc, both get closer as they decrypt banned files, revealing the depressing truth behind Omni-Dent’s safety record and raising the alarm about why these malfunctions were never disclosed.

Miniaturized drones fan out around the glowing healthcare towers while emotions run high as Lila, with Marc’s support, exposes the data leaks directly to the public through Josie's stream, future of augmented dentistry hanging in the balance. Shockwaves spread through Neo-Venice as regulatory bodies scramble to intervene, vowing to reassess the laws into which citizens have placed blind faith. Josie points out differing experiences across socioeconomic lines when fans realize that affluent apartments have benefitted significantly from a glitch-free Omni-Dent, further driving citizens apart. Surrounded by police, Lila and Marc momentarily find themselves lodged in the limelight as unsung heroes amidst protests for rooting out the dialogue-free tech-crisis leftovers.

In the wake of the scandal, changes unfold rapidly. Lila, working hand in hand with regulators, takes a bold stand by devoting the next year to improved oversight of dental technology and ensuring an integrated system: combining the wisdom of the humane touch with the efficiency of AI-powered diagnostics. Josie, her credibility battered but fervent, helps advocate for social equity in technology access for therapy. Meanwhile, Marc finds a new calling, researching the impact of augmented healthcare on society. As citizens rebuild their confidence, with new regulations implemented to shape the future, Neo-Venice moves toward an era that balances human expertise with technological marvels, shedding a cautious new light on the dynamic, futuristic path for dental health.
