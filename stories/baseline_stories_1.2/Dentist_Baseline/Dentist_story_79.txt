In the year 2045, the role of dentists has transformed dramatically. What was once a mundane clinic visit has evolved into an immersive health experience facilitated by advanced technology. The DentaSphere—a virtual reality platform—replaces traditional dental chairs, allowing patients to explore an interactive world while their procedures occur seamlessly in real time. Dr. Mira Zhang, known for her empathetic nature and pioneering techniques, runs one of the most sought-after practices in Neo-Tokyo. Her primary assistant, Ethan, is an AI-human hybrid who possesses a wealth of knowledge and practices rapid analysis to determine each individual patient’s dental needs. The narrative is driven by the contrasting perspectives of Mira, Ethan, Sarah—a frightened music teacher with a debilitating fear of dental appointments, and Lance, a rebel who advocates for anti-tech dentistry.

As demander technologies become more prevalent, those wary of mechanical intrusion and uploaded consciousness engage in protests, arguing that the human touch has become an afterthought. When the government announces mandatory enrollment in the automated health program, merging medical records into a central AI database, Mira is torn. She loves the convenience and opportunities technology brings, but she worries about losing the personal touch in dentistry. During a city-wide strike ignited by the protests, Sarah suddenly arrives at Mira’s clinic in tears, fearing that she may lose her teeth due to neglect in her routines. Ethan, programmed to prioritize patient care, counsels Mira to forge a deeper bond with Sarah through empathy.

Together, the trio confronts Lance during one of the protests outside the mega-dentist headquarters. Ethan's processing capabilities help unearth data from tech-rebel circles, revealing an underground movement to dismantle the DentaSphere. Tensions escalate when Mira decides to speak at the upcoming meeting of protesters, revealing her vision of combining the best aspects of both worlds—the psychological comfort of human touch along with technology efficiently aiding treatment. The approaching events set their destinies on a collision course. During the meeting, Lance accuses Mira of abandoning tradition and ostracizing patients’ fears; however, his emotional rant inadvertently sways Sarah with a harsh reminder of her own insecurities about technology.

Conflict reaches its peak when a riot erupts at the head office as straggling protesters clash with security. In the chaos, a side window shatters, and it exposes hidden data vaults containing unethical practices by the conglomerate—the exploitation of emergency personal data and the lack of consent for automated treatments. Pillars of glass crash down metaphysically on the ivory tower of DentaSphere propaganda. Using live feeds highlighting these wrongdoings, Mira puts forth her vision that marries advanced tech sensibility with human instinct, leveraging the emotional testimony that embraces individuality over mere data reports.

A week later, DentaSphere recalibrates their approach to dental health onboarding newly developed drone-backed treatments, addressing weaknesses laid bare during the protest. Mira's position as a blend of tech and humanistic care places her firm in a new light, emphasizing patient-centered procedures rooted in personal communication. Fortress regulations balancing innovation equality also spread rapidly across the government, garnering cooperative relationships between human providers and technology. Politically ignited by the chaos turn of events, Sarah nudged by her trauma, finds resolve to help others overcome their fears and re-engages with their oral health before it’s too late—becoming a confidante for new patients in Mira’s practice, showing genuine empathy and kindness to all.
