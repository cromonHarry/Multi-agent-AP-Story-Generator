In the year 2045, the profession of dentistry has transformed into a high-tech, almost theatrical experience. Now called "Denta-Artists", dental practitioners enhance both the health and aesthetics of their patient's smiles with the aid of advanced nanotechnology, virtual reality simulations, and bioprinted dental implants. In this society, maintaining an ideal smile is not just a health mandate but a social requirement, mapped thoroughly in social implants that analyze every aspect of a person’s tooth aesthetics MP (Monitoring Points). Our protagonist, Lila Tran, is a young aspiring Denta-Artist, eager to prove herself in her father's prestigious dental clinic, Gleam & Glow. Her father, Dr. Harold Tran, is a revered Denta-Artist who relies on traditional arts he learned in the age of manual dentistry—a distinct approach that places value in the artistry of a smile.

One day, Lila encounters Jamal Knox, a charming but rebellious teenager whose mouth is full of riddled dental faux pas due to his aversion to aesthetics and implant technology. Jamal is resistant to technological enhancements, having been raised in a fringe community that values individualism over genetically designed conformity. Intrigued by his unique perspective, Lila forms a bond with Jamal as she becomes his unlikely Denta-Artist. As the two navigate his treatment, Jamal's critiques of societal standards cause Lila to question whether dental perfection is truly a reflection of wellbeing or merely an illusion based on cultural ideals. However, tension currencies in her father’s office; Dr. Tran views Jamal's condition as a profane assault on the modern dental benchmark, pushing Lila to reconcile her loyalty to tradition and the social Eichmann represented by Jamal.

The story reaches its peak during the annual Smile Summit, a highly-publicized biotechnology gala where Denta-Artists unveil groundbreaking techniques. There, Jamal unexpectedly takes a stand, expressing his fears that the pursuit of artificial perfection neglects one's true self. An impromptu demonstration allows him to openly compare his natural smile, combined with charming imperfections, against curated model smiles wearing bioprinted implants. Lila watches anxiously as her father’s authority challenges Jamal in a public debate on aesthetics and ethics, creating an uproar in the otherwise composed ceremony. Just when Dr. Tran unanimously panders to the norm, Lila makes a choice that astonishes everyone—she supports Jamal’s viewpoint, revealing her hidden sense of rebellion against enforced beauty norms and emphasizing artistry in the natural form.

In the aftermath, Lila faces the consequences of her choice and is distanced from her father, who severs their professional ties, urging her to find a more suitable role – or wash out as a Denta-Artist. Encountering her feelings of loss, yet unshaken in resolve, Lila and Jamal join forces to build an independent practice—the Unorthodox Smile Initiative—focusing on enchanting smiles without the harbingers of perfection. Bonded by a shared vision of rejuvenating independence, they help misfits and rebels alike to celebrate their unique qualities. With their distinct approach, their practice slowly garners support from those disillusioned with societal expectations, empowering individuals to reclaim their identities beyond curated smiles.

As their movement surges, Lila reflects on change—she has replaced strictly enforced routes with authentic journeys. Proud to cultivate a salon where anyone is free from judgement while embracing individuality, she continuously blends artistry with health care in breathtaking ways. Meanwhile, a transformed Dr. Tran steadily observes beyond the boundaries of tradition, eventually grasping what Lila has ignited—the potential for nuance thriving in imperfection. In the unprecedented shadows of the world he constructed, he lets go of rigid standards, fathoming the beauty in paradigms beyond perfection.
