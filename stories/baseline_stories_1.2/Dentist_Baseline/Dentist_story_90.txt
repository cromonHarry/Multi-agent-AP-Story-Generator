In the year 2085, dental care has transformed dramatically with the advent of advanced nanotechnology, making the “dentist” of the past almost unrecognizable. People visit Denti-Centers where automated machines, known as Denticoids, equipped with AI dental knowledge, administer preventive care, making traditional tooth decay and pain relics of a bygone era. Dr. Lila Serafine leads one of the most cutting-edge Denti-Centers within a sprawling megacity. She often als24i interacts with patients through a holographic interface at her mobile station, Spark 8, always keeping emotional connections through AR technology. Among her colleagues are Kei, a neurotech expert who works on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Denticoids, and Elise, a quirky receptionist with dreams of becoming a virtual reality dental content creator. However, beneath the shiny surface of this utopia lies a dark secret—a newer model of Denticoids has started malfunctioning, causing catastrophic outcomes in nearby districts.

Tension mounts when Lila receives alarming data from an organized group known as the Alveolarians, who oppose this reliance on automated dental care. Their leader, Dr. Victor Lore, who practices traditional dentistry out of ethical concerns, rallies for a public forum where he seeks to expose the flaws in the Denti-Centers. He believes that while the Denticoids alleviate most problems, they generate a dependency that could spell societal collapse if anything were to compromise them. Lila is torn between her commitment to improving patient care through innovation and ensuring that potential dangers are addressed. When Elise uncovers hidden reports detailing recurring failures in the Denticoids sealed by corporate interest, Lila faces a moral dilemma once more; revealing the truth may damage her career but ignoring it may risk lives across the metropolis.

As the day of the forum approaches, Lila realizes she must step forward, despite the possible consequences. The climax occurs during a live demonstration at the bustling public square, where Dr. Lore intricately designs a program to reveal fabricated data from higher-ups. Before he can showcase it, unexpected gang members loyal to the corporation take matters into their own hands, cutting power to the square and malfunctioning the Denticoid controlling the exhibit. In a shocking twist, Lila, Kei, and Elise join together to hack S3-SY, the central intelligence of the Denticoids, attempting to regain control. Amidst the chaos, they learn firsthand just how dependent—and vulnerable—the city bombards itself in relation to its nanotechnology.

With the Denti-Center at a standstill, Lila's new plan emerges through her quick thinking—a contingency capable of reverting the Denticoids temporarily to safe operational states while protecting those in danger. Utilizing Elise’s skills in augmented realities, they create illusions to distract the chaotic crowd while Kei physically interfaces to resolve system faults. Slowly, the Denticoids regain control, overcoming rocketing panic and silencing the fury of gang menaces while unveiling significant truths that haunt the lavish city. However, this small victory raises critical questions about society's dependence on technology and third-party corporations.

The community, moved by real-time events, rallies behind Lila and Victor to seek a compromise between robotic assistance and human oversight in dental practices. Horror stories surrounding the faulty Denticoids multiply outside the megacity, igniting conversations about protecting patient autonomy and ethical practices in healthcare. Eventually, Lila shops her own Denti-Center techniques to work with Dr. Lore on a new framework aimed at integrating the best of both worlds, where preventive care thrives in a sustainable capacity bolstered by resilient human presence in every community. Their friendship, founded in mutual respect for the future’s maternal caregivers, symbolizes hope destined to shape the unpredictable dawn—of a redefined role for Dentists.
