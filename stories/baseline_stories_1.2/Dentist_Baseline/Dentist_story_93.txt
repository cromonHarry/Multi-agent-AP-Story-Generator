In the year 2042, oral health has transcended traditional dental practices, transforming the dentist's role from a mere practitioner to a high-tech specialist known as a BioDentist. Sonic cleaning devices, nanotechnology, and advanced predictive algorithms have made dental issues nearly obsolete, yet the rise of genetic manipulation has cultivated artistry within the practice of aesthetics. In this brave new world, Dr. Shea Talbot, a visionary BioDentist, operates in a floating clinic above Metropolis, and her enigmatic assistant, Kai, possesses an uncanny ability to empathize with patients—even those with aversions to dental care. Enter Morgan, a restless teen with a series of genetic enhancements that did little to grant her a perfect smile, and Theo, an old-school dentist unwilling to relinquish his traditional, tactile methods.

With a diverse clientele in need of bioengineering, Dr. Talbot's floating practice buzzes with novelties, although she can’t shake the feeling that technology is overshadowing the core essence of patient interaction. The real challenges arise when Morgan, after years of being cajoled into routine coding by her parents, reluctantly schedules an appointment for a custom biowardener—an intricate implant intended to not only maintain but enhance her already-modified teeth. Just days before her appointment, Morgan overhears a conspiracy brewing: whispers that a shadowy organization intends to steal files regarding personal enhancements from BioDentists to manipulate the genetic makeup of patients, putting her health—and psyche—at risk.

As tensions simmer around the clinic, Dr. Talbot’s innovation is put to the test! A malfunction of the central bioengine causes communications to fail and automated security becomes erratic. Patients trapped within the clinic, including Morgan, find themselves united in fear while Kai's instinctive compassion proves vital under pressure. Theo, who has dedicated his life to old-world dentistry, springs into action with his hands-on skills to restore order alongside the tech-savvy Kai. Lots of emotional barriers emerge as patients confront their scrutinized perceptions of beauty, together confronting their trauma and attachment to technology—desperate and needy, they foster unexpected friendships in the fray.

As they navigate a crumbling tech scene, brilliant sparks uncover a deeper connection between Dr. Talbot and her artistry. Morgan begins to accept who she is without excessive enhancements, deciding for herself if she wants her unique traits reformed. Despite some technological assistance, it soon becomes evident that the strength embodied by human resilience, compassion, and collaboration fuels a reconnection between Dr. Talbot's methods and her patients. Theo ultimately reveals dangerous secrets about connections to this shadowy organization, choosing to assist Dr. Talbot in tracking down those responsible for instigating melee.

With the clinic secured, Dr. Talbot takes a moment to reflect on her journey intertwining the artistry of dental practice with humanity in crisis. Reinvigorated by the once-unknown strengths uncovered in crisis, Morgan chooses to embrace her imperfections, sharing stories of self-acceptance with both her peers and social networks. On the floating clinic's edge, her sunset smile shines a gleaming testimony to rediscovered organic beauty, yet floated along with hopeful discussions echoing importance of human touch amongst surreal advancements. With Theo close, Kai remarks on their potential revolution in waiting to redefine the meaning of a dentist—as caretakers on the frontlines of not just oral health, but holistic evolution.
