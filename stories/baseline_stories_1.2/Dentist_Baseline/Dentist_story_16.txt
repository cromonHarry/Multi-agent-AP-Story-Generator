In the year 2045, dental care has transcended the realm of traditional clinics. Welcome to Dentosure, a sprawling corporate facility that employs advanced bioengineering and artificial intelligence to handle all aspects of oral health. The four main characters find themselves intertwined in this high-tech landscape. Dr. Lena Reyes, a former human dentist turned telemetry specialist, now works alongside ARROW (Artificial Responsive Robotic Operator for Wellness), a highly intelligent server AI designed to manage patient experiences and track oral health trends. Max Finch, an inquisitive teenage patient who barely scratches below the surface of his own dental woes, often challenges the unnerving efficiency of the system. Then, there’s Sara Jin, a disgruntled health journalist seeking to expose an underground network that is determined to show the risks of mandatory dental implants at Dentosure clinics.

Patients are accustomed to arriving for check-ups and only scanning their smiles into a digital interface, which initiates the self-driven treatment process without any interpersonal interaction. Growing up in this environment, Max has never felt a proper connection with a dentist. Bored by the obligatory “mouth scans,” he finds solace in his guardian, retired dentist Dr. Lynne Caldwell, who operates an underground clinic that eschews technology in favor of humanized care. Dr. Caldwell instills pride in maintaining ‘natural dental integrity’ in a world obsessed with perfection through implants and enhancements. To fulfill the adolescent urge for rebellion, Max sneaks back and forth between the sterile corridors of Dentosure and his guardian's haven, unknowingly bridging the two worlds and reigniting an appreciation for human touch amidst advanced dentistry.

Tensions arise when Dr. Reyes receives a series of alarming data transmissions about malfunctions in the dentally interfaced neural implants being propagated by Dentosure. These implants promise revolutionary communication between the mouth and the brain, eliminating the need for traditional dental exams. Max's implant reacts to changes in his biochemistry, causing erratic behavior just at the moment Dr. Reyes begins unraveling a potential conspiracy beneath the gleam of Dentosure's marketing truths. When violent headaches lead Max to collapse during an exposure event for dental journalists, it’s Dr. Reyes and ARROW’s duty to take immediate action, clashing with upper management that is desperate to keep damages hidden—bringing resolution to a line between technological brilliance and possible catastrophe.

While ARROW analyzes data amidst panic, Dr. Reyes confronts upper management and unexpectedly discovers the conglomerate's priority system. They water down safety warnings about the implants, aiming for heightened profits driven by misleading marketing strategies. Meanwhile, in an adrenaline-charged showdown, Dr. Caldwell triangulates the unfolding crisis and prepares commission immunity for Max, who surprisingly becomes the critical test subject unmasking disturbing correlations between implant errors, corporate greed, and fast-tracked innovations. Rallying for justice, Max, Dr. Reyes, and even ARROW attempt to publicize the documentations that threaten Dentosure’s pristine facade, ultimately turning the internal struggles of health care against the reality of human-driven principles.

With Max’s experience propelling a new wave of patient advocacy, the world unravels its dependence on cold efficiency in dental care. The incident reshapes the public opinion on dental advancements pointing toward a healthier, holistic evolution in the industry. Dentosure reformulates its policies following pressure from the community and catches notice of Goodman Health—and, led by Dr. Reyes' advocacy for a blend of technological and personalized care—backs the proposed legislation meant to return dental expertise to human hands. The underground network flourishes, capitalizing on the beleaguered fears of uncontrolled corporatism. Vanishing are hollow smiles spawned from ineffable wires; they are being replaced with genuine, proud grins reflecting health once knew before technologically skimmed perfection became the final frontier of the oral biome.
