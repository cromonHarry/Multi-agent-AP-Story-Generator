In the year 2045, dental care has transformed into a realm of advanced technology and augmented reality, paving the way for a specialized career as a "Neurodentist." The protagonist, Lena Cruz, a skilled young practitioner, operates in a vibrant megacity intertwined with bioluminescent structures. In this world, Instant Dental Communication (IDC) allows patients to connect with dentists via neural interfaces, experiencing virtual consultations and procedures from the comfort of their homes. Her patients include Kim, a celebrity influencer obsessed with perfect aesthetics; Evan, a Support AI programmer burdened by anxiety around dental health; and Dr. Murray Light, the aging inventor behind the revolutionary IDC technology now facing obsolescence due to unforeseen consequences.

As Lena gains a reputation for treating patients effectively, she becomes anxious about the addiction-driven reliance on IDC. Kim, enamored with the seamless connection to fragments of her character's reality, becomes addicted, setting off a wave of patients who prefer remote consultations over traditional visits. Meanwhile, Evan struggles with the pressure to maintain a simulated perfect smile. As addiction to technology rises, Lena witnesses a troubling trend of anxiety, decreased physical activity, and emotional disconnection in her patients, prompting her to seek alternatives that rejuvenate human connection within dental care.

Pressured by societal norms and her growing subconscious fears, her desperation mounts as Kim insinuates through her online presence that neurodentistry is transformative rather than invasive, garnering more patients. In the confrontational atmosphere, Lena feels stuck between her medical ethics and financial survival, especially as Dr. Light's revelations about the long-term repercussions of continuous cerebral adjustments shake her resolve. During a local public health emergency involving rampant IDC technical failures, which lead to a spike in untreated oral issues, patients descend into crisis mode, further complicating Lena's battle for balance between virtual and tactile care.

In the aftermath of the IDC collapse, social media exposes the hidden truth of distorted smiles and deteriorating identities behind screen personas. Manifold patients begin seeking honest interactions and authentic dental interventions from Lena while establishing support groups that prioritize health over aesthetic obsessions. Confronted by Evan’s genuine request for human touch in the clinic to overcome his fears, and after a candid meeting with Dr. Light about wider implications of holistic health, Lena debates taking bold action within the industry.

Fueled by newfound resolve, Lena orchestrates a movement rallying against reliance on IDC and advocating for integrated care that reinvigorates traditional dental practices. She shares success stories and unveils an initiative melding technology and interpersonal healing rather than manipulation. Lena transforms her practice to emphasize human connection while promoting awareness around the necessity for balance in the evolving healthcare landscape. Kim and Evan become allies, leading the outreach toward healthier mindsets within the sphere of cosmetic enhancement, illustrating that the future of dentistry transcends technology, entrusting humanity's essence in every smile treated.
