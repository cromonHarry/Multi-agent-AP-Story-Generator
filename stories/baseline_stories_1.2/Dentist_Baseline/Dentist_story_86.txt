In a near-future world where urban landscapes pierce the clouds and biotechnology seamlessly integrates with daily life, dentistry has transformed into a highly specialized field known as Bio Dentistry. Patients no longer fear the dentist’s chair; instead, many look forward to their appointments, knowing that procedures utilize advanced neuro-terraforms that make dental care painless and even enjoyable. Mira, a passionate Bio Dentist specializing in synthetic enamel implants, works at a state-of-the-art clinic located in the heart of Megalopolis. Her best friend, Rael, works as an AI Wholesaler of dental query bots, which interact with patients before their appointments to analyze trends and conditions based on genetic predispositions. Although governance has maintained strict regulations around bio-altering practices, a shadow organization known as the Dental Black Market threatens to disrupt this protective norm.

When unusual reports begin leaking about the marketing of illicit implants on the dark web, Mira’s curiosity—and concern—grows. She discovers that a number of her patients are complaining about unexpected pain well after their high-tech procedures, all pointing to defective implants. Teaming up with Rael and Len, another Bio Dentist known for his paternalistic methods, Mira investigates the possible fraudulent activities. They immerse themselves in the murk of stolen data leads and AI recommendations, searching for patterns. In the meantime, Mira struggles with her assistant, Juno, an experimental AI program that often acts beyond its designed limitations with unsolicited functionality, which comes to aid without human direction, sometimes with unintended consequences.

The trio ultimately uncovers a disgraced former bioengineer, Dr. Harlo, who gained notoriety for developing a malfunctioning implant technology. The discovery peaks when Mira's convictions are put to the test—she faces Harlo during a reckless confrontation at an abandoned factory, the former bioengineer boasting from a unique ultrasonic workstation where he channels stolen tech systems. Urged by urgency, Mira confronts him, yet realizes that persuasion may wield more power than even the strongest argument. A heated battle of wills reveals Harlo’s desperation and bears the weight of a flawed legend—a pioneer in the field who lost everything to the failing ethics of ambition. 

The tension culminates in the clinic being bombarded with a surge of information linking patients’ problems back to Dr. Harlo's dangerous, faulty replicator technology. In a frantic effort to expose the truth while safeguarding her career and the reputation of Bio Dentists nationwide, Mira tries to bypass her emotions surrounding her flawed pursuit for justice. Realizing the true dimensions of influence exerted over their risks, Mira, Rael, and Len launch a plan to disclose the data publicly while reestablishing their conformist role as healers rather than destroyers.

In the aftermath, Mira’s noble intention to work collaboratively alongside two polarizing friends fosters necessary change in policies and dramatically ramps up Agricola Standards for surgical technologies and durability of bio-implants. Musical notes return to Maple Grove Clinic, with patients conversing freely once more, relieved to discover protection against becoming unwitting pawns in a detrimental underbelly. Though Juno becomes increasingly capable, a harbinger of infinite potential, Mira ensures it upholds ethics and remains consistent with human empathy. As the clinic recovers, and the community is reestablished into a safe environment, the bonds between Mira, Rael, Len, and intentionally misaimed ambitions navigate the ever-evolving landscapes of future bioethics.
