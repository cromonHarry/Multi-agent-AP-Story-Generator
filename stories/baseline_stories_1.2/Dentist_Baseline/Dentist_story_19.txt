In the near future, society's perception of dental health has transformed dramatically. Dental clinics have evolved into advanced biomechanical hubs where artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and virtual reality converge. Among these pioneering dentists is Dr. Mira Lane, a celebrated figure in the field with her own AI assistant, Quirk, who can predict and diagnose dental problems before they appear. The patient demographic has also shifted dramatically; People's smiles have evolved with the advent of gene editing, leading to a growing class bred for perfect aesthetics. Yet, a sector of society struggles with genetically imperfect teeth—the “natural enhanceds.” This dichotomy creates tension, particularly for Edgar, a natural enhanced who believes in preserving his heritage instead of conforming to societal ideals of perfection.

Amid rising societal pressures, Dr. Lane receives an invitation to attend the Trans-Central Dental Symposium, where she is slated to showcase her revolutionary dental nanobots that not only repair cavities but also rewire nerves to eliminate pain. Enthused, she gathers her best protégé, Isaac, an ambitious young dentist eager to prove himself. However, as they prepare for their presentation, Quirk discovers a hidden agenda: a faction of biotech conglomerates seeking to use Dr. Lane’s innovations to manipulate genetic engineering for mercenary purposes, profiting off the weak while limiting access to the unwealthy, specifically targeting those like Edgar and his peers. Dr. Lane is torn between staying true to her ethical responsibility or embracing the possibility of great fame and fortune.

Dr. Lane's internal struggle crescendos just days before the symposium when she witnesses a public debate inciting discrimination against “real” smiles led by a renowned anti-natural enhanced activist, Dalia Bright. Edgar steps up to voice his anger, passionately arguing against the normalization of manufactured beauty. His grassroots revolution offers hope to the marginalized, ultimately leading Dr. Lane, Isaac, and Edgar to unite as they quietly plot to use Dr. Lane’s platform at the symposium as a voice for change, highlighting the real human experience in an increasingly artificial landscape.

On the day of the symposium, Dalia realizes that Dr. Lane plans to reveal her findings about the ethical implications of her technologies and the detrimental side effects of the prevailing perceptions about dental perfection. In a desperate attempt to thwart them, she colludes with the biotech corporations to sabotage the live feed, projecting easily manipulated data that underscores the risks of natural dental aesthetics. However, as Dr. Lane, Isaac, and Edgar continue their presentation through irony, addressing it to the gathered crowd uninvited and remonstrating within the crowd, genuine conversations ensue that bring forth transparency, revealing the truth about their treatments to large audiences.

The gathering becomes a crisis forum, eventually shifting perceptions about what it really means to "fix" one's teeth. Audience members demand their voices to be heard, propelling change across societal attitudes towards natural as well as engineered identities. In the wake of this unexpected collaboration, laws and regulations begin reshaping dentifriceworks, ensuring equitable access to dental care and advocating for appreciation of genuine self-expression. Edgar's quest sparks a burgeoning movement that gathers momentum, with Dr. Lane wading into her next chapter, using her knowledge to craft a future where all smiles—whether flawless or flawed—claim the same level of respect.
