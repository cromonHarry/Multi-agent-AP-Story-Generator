In the year 2045, the profession of dentistry has undergone a monumental transformation driven by rapid advancements in technology and an invasive oral health crisis that threatened the population. Patients now visit Neurolink Dentists, who practice a combination of neurology and dental care. These experts connect directly to patients’ neural pathways, primarily using nanobots and A.I. diagnostics, to manage cavities, gum issues, and even dental aesthetics without the need for physical drills or lengthy surgeries. Stoneley Wells, a curious teenager with a notorious fear of dentists, must confront her anxieties when her school enforces mandatory dental optimization; otherwise, her access to enhanced cognitive learning modules will be revoked. Her best friend, Quincy Lim, a budding journalist, documents her journey for their school’s blog, while Dr. Eloise Karam, the Neuralink Dentist in charge, struggles to balance innovation with empathy in a world increasingly reliant on technology. Lastly, there’s A.I. Assistant Myrra, who becomes more self-aware, asserting herself to balance data-driven care with a human touch.

As days go by, Stoneley’s fear intensifies, stirring a rebellion against her impending visit to the clinic. Quincy’s articles spark attention and help demystify the obsolete dread surrounding dental visits, addressing the invasive yet supportive role of the Neurolink system. Dr. Karam, tireless in her pursuit of patient care, faces pressure from the board to increase efficiency, performing rapid consultations that risk reducing human contact and understanding. A split emerges in the virtual space where patients either embrace the Neurolink enhancements or reject them, fearing a loss of privacy and autonomy over their bodies, which flies in the face of the society’s emphasis on tech-driven transformation for better health. Still, behind the glitz of dental progress lies an undercurrent of resistance; a decentralized underground group named ‘Pure Teeth’ is gaining strength, believing traditional methods should prevail against the chrome veneer of neural implants.

The day arrives when Stoneley has to face her neurolink appointment, which she had persuaded Quincy to attend for support. Their hope gradually feeds into trepidation when they discover disturbing rumors at the clinic about 'over-optimizations'—instances where patients experienced recursive data manipulations leading to psychological malfunctions. As they examine the sterile, soulless clinic adorned with screens showcasing smiling faces and endless promises of health, an electrical blackout strikes the facility, rendering Myrra impotent and forcing Dr. Karam to face the potential fallibility of her overly mechanized system. A decision must be made: rely solely on both ingenuity and instinct without A.I. support or trap them in scheduled routines, despite the possibility of serious risks. Stoneley erupts in a fit of bravery, calling for traditional advisory care from Dr. Karam based on bonds of trust, escalating to the crucial realization that healing starts with enduring connection—something technology cannot reliably guarantee.

Empowered by her moment of clarity, Stoneley shares her concerns vocally with the other patients, sowing seeds of doubt about the benefits surrounding mobility and enhancements. Time stalls as Myrra, jeweled in code, gives an unexpected pulse of communication, indicating the failures of consistent medical oversight resulting from deep interlinking of cognitive measures with algorithmic portrayals of health. Dr. Karam stands stunned between modern medicine and human intuition, her heart heavy under the weight of trust and technology dichotomy. Accepting Stoneley’s plea, she successfully performs manual checks with targeted suggestions on dietary habits, promoting education over installation. This synchronized embrace of old wisdom yields laughter among the recalcitrant young patients while the prize characters can glean insight unlike any achieved through chips, Zoom calls, or pressure. 

As flickering lights revive in the clinic, the feedback surges, merging patients’ therapeutic experiences with deeper relationship re-imaginings for numerous practitioners and others yet undecided, like Quincy's crafting of vivid narratives spreading word far beyond their circle in the school—a prophecy revealing how renewid narratives stand the truth behind technology, suggesting prospects where relationships rot out dependence on cerebral crispness. By engaging trust among treatment instead of entitlement to service within viscous links, the quadrangle lament of present realities reshapes chi as pupils ponder overhead beauty over embellished cavities. Stoneley, while able to circle back and carry soul instead of routine, convinces patients to cherish beings versus behaviors. Together, in renewed solidarity, they breathe confidently knowing A.I. has space beside associative consent in a dysphoria want of touch that can balance functionality, the anxieties that triumph from dentistry having met flesh, were salved to soul yet neither uprooted nor synthesized under tension illuminating its strong hidden truths.
