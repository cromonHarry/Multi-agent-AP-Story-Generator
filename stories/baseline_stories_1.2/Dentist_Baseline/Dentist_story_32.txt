In the year 2045, dentistry has transformed into a high-tech field, merging traditional practices with sophisticated AI and nanotechnology. In this world, dentists are replaced by "dental engineers," skilled professionals whose primary tools are advanced biotechnological implants and automated nanobots. Among them is Dr. Zara Hébert, a prodigious dental engineer who designs custom solutions for patients' oral needs in the sprawling city of Neo-Lumen. Her best friend, Kieran, an AI healthcare specialist, chips in with data analysis to predict potential dental emergencies. Meanwhile, young patients are represented by Lila, a curious 10-year-old eager to maintain her brilliant, synthetic crystal smile. Lastly, the antagonist, Dr. Rourke, advocates for the risky practice of "tooth engineering," where patients replace their natural teeth with complex biomechanical substitutes, leading to controversial safety concerns.

Dr. Hébert's routine begins with a calculated influx of patients lining up to receive services powered by miniaturized nanobots—tiny machines programmed to perform complex procedures non-invasively. However, Kieran makes unsettling observations about a rise in cases where the nanobots malfunction, causing patients pain instead of relief. Concerned, Zara and Kieran begin to investigate but quickly discover that Dr. Rourke’s enthusiasm for tooth engineering lured many patients away from traditional methods, leaving behind a backlog that prioritizes profit over patient health. Lila finds herself caught between her admiration for the shiny futures promised by tooth engineering and her spontaneous visits to Dr. Hébert.

As disbelief turns to urgency, the story escalates when Lila, suffering from an anxiety-ridden phobia of dentists, skips over a scheduled appointment, going instead to confront Dr. Rourke, who entertains her with his charismatic but opaque promises of “perfection.” As visits become increasingly invasive and reliant on risky enhancements, Lila soon meets another child lobbyist, Rashid, who shares her deep concerns about the feasibility of bioengineered teeth. Teaming up with Zara and Kieran, Lila embarks on a quest through the neon-lit urban underground of Neo-Lumen to uncover secrets about Dr. Rourke’s unethical practices and the gloomy consequences lurking within his bio-surgery headquarters.

The climax occurs during an unannounced press conference hosted by Dr. Rourke, where Lila stands before the crowd with startling transparency. She reveals personal stories alongside a technology-savvy exposé crafted by Kieran that showcases children suffering from severe side effects of tooth engineering. Just as Rourke begins to lose control over the situation, Kieran debriefs a wave of reparative research he uncovered regarding restore-to-natural procedures led by Dr. Hébert, re-igniting hope for safe dental care practices. The contrast between the gentle manipulation akin to around-the-clock tap water flows instantly nominalizes Rourke's reputation among families.

In the resolution, Dr. Rourke’s empire crumbles ebbing along with the skepticism. Lila's voice elevates advocates for protection legislation ensuring children’s access to harmless dental work. Dr. Hébert re-establishes her clinic and fosters programs convincingly akin to communal agreements for educational panels demonstrating conscientious oral care to preserve natural integrity. As citizens advocate for traditional methods, the city teeters toward a delicate balance between innovative artistry and ethical responsibility, where children and future generations will likely coexist with technology rather than above or beneath it—the essence of care defined not by machinery but by understanding and community support.
