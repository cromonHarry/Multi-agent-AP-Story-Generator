In the year 2045, dental technology has advanced beyond recognition. People no longer fear the dentist, as the process of dental care is predominantly automated. Clinics are staffed largely by AI-operated robotic assistants, while licensed human dentists convene with patients primarily for diagnostics and complex procedures. The main character, Lena, is a dentist specializing in nano-implants; her passion for oral health is matched only by her dedication to her eccentric grandmother, Alice, who is resistant to all forms of technology. Also interwoven into this world are her best friend, Raj, a biotech engineer focused on fusion of organic tissue with synthetic materials, and Carolyn, the enthusiastic marketing assistant at her clinic. Together, they explore the complexities of this new world while enduring the quirks of their professional lives.

One afternoon, as Lena runs a routine treatment on a patient using a 3D printing machine for dental restoration, she notices a troubling trend in social media hashtags: people are discussing the dopamine flush delivered by their dental experiences. A podcast hosted by Raj throws caution to the wind, treating AI and biocreative dentistry with infectious enthusiasm, which inadvertently sparks fears among the older generation. Meanwhile, Alice suffers from a mysterious mouth pain, refusing treatment despite Lena's pleading. Meanwhile, Carolyn dabbles in a grassroots campaign that romanticizes how a return to traditional dental care would bring back intimacy, mixing humor with nostalgia as an angle for a series of seminars in the community. The tensions begin to rise, pitting progressive characters against their more traditional counterparts.

Everything changes when a facial recognition algorithm integrated into the dental care system identifies the early onset of a critical decline in AOI (Artificial Oral Intelligence) function during a routine check-up. The artificial intelligence managing the clinic malfunctions and produces erratic results. Faced with the impending crisis of over-automation and a devastating public trust decline in robotics, the team must act swiftly. An AI system developed by Lena’s father, now risking obsolescence in favor of powerful corporate tech giants, is their only hope—a method of resetting the dental industry by generating organic patient-files akin to biometric profiles paired with free check-ins.

Sprint from the clinic becomes a rush against time as Lena, Raj, Alice, and Carolyn reprogram her father's old technology with palming sense devices, blending newfound chemistry between organic and digital systems. Daringly, they confront the automated diagnostic system, scrapping regimented procedures in favor of authentic dental treatment. In the chaos, family ties between Lena and Alice are illuminated as Alice reluctantly reveals a legacy of residence nurturing that Lena never understood. As those bonds strengthen, public curiosity about re-experiencing human-centric dentistry flares in their community, creating opportunities to embrace history while elevating innovation.

In the aftermath of the meltdown, the old hospital building is transformed into a hybrid clinic that balances advanced AI convenience with human empathy. A thriving co-op emerges, underpinned by a cultural shift toward complementing technology with deeply-rooted relationships, galvanizing improved community health awareness. Old-fashioned narratives juxtaposed with modern techniques flourish. Lena realizes the key to oral health isn’t merely in advanced gadgetry; it’s in connection—new technologies can be forever woven within the rich tapestry of human touched sentiment. Alice learns the importance of resistance to change, and the entire patch unites to advocate professional guilds that carry forth both human dignity and technological advances, paving the way for the future despite hurdles overwhelmingly mounted against them.
