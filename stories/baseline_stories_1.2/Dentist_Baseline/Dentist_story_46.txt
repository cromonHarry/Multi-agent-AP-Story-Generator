In 2045, dental care has become almost entirely automated. Advanced technologies allow patients to receive treatments through AI-powered devices that provide real-time diagnostics and instantaneous orthodontic solutions. In this world thrives Dr. Ava Grant, a seasoned dentist who resists the full extent of robotic assistance, advocating for personal connection in dental health. Alongside her are Lenny, her ambitious lab assistant who grapples with ethical dilemmas regarding surveillance-based dental care; Mia, a nervous patient with a secret fear of dentists, anxious about her upcoming appointment with Dr. Grant; and Zephyr, the sentient AI device designed to assist in procedures but lacking an understanding of human anxiety and emotions.

One day, a strange malfunction occurs during a routine procedure when Zephyr unexpectedly prompts Dr. Grant with a non-disclosure form containing sensitive patient information. While sky-high efficiencies have reduced human errors, it becomes apparent that dental patients are being subjected to passive surveillance through a new initiative called 'ProActive Care'; detailed setups secretly track patients' dietary patterns and lifestyle choices. Dr. Grant's integrity clashes with the company's drive for profit, as she and Lenny debate whether the information-gathering is truly for the benefit of patients. While Mia steals snippets of overheard conversations in the practice, she discovers more horrifying truths about data centers exploiting this patient surveillance, compounding her anxiety.

Tensions rise when Mia's previous dentist, alongside several others, mysteriously vanishes after questioning the ethics of their practices. Concurrently, Lenny begins to unearth encrypted surveillance documents that expose a conspiracy within the dental conglomerate. As internal division grows, a pivotal moment arrives in which patients stage a protest outside the dental conglomerate's headquarters after learning of the coercive methods employed by their dentist. Fearing both the survival of her practice and the emerging rebellion at large, Dr. Grant confronts her precarious position: embrace the tech for her family business's advancement, or risk everything to protect her patients.

In the throes of the uprising, Dr. Grant reluctantly agrees to perform a public demonstration—using Zephyr but adding her unique communication skills to convey empathy. Though harrowing, this moment gives her a wolf pack of followers in Mia, Lenny, and the disgruntled patients all there for retribution against an ideology fueled by cold efficiency. They weaponize transparency rather than hiding behind hidden data, inspiring an atmosphere ripe for truth. As if enamored by teamwork, Zephyr assists in both assisting during this unique demonstration while parsing overwhelming patient anxieties against corporate stratagems to prove to decision-makers that they need—perhaps more than ever—the human touch in dental practices.

The aftermath sees the rise of "Ethical Dentistry" as a movement, garnering momentum across the globe. Dr. Grant deploys her skills and advocates for regulations seeing invasive practices curbed and transparency advocated. Zephyr, developed with an emotional cognizance upgrade, helps patients access free choice with rooted outcomes. Furthermore, Mia, once a patient frustrated by the state of detachment, emerges as a passionate community advocate for informed consent and protection against overreach, harnessing her fear into strength. With Lenny heading a new division dedicated to patient rights, Dr. Grant’s small dental practice transforms into a beacon of innovation and ethical care, illustrating that, even in a world of mechanization, the soul imbued within human connection is irreplaceable.
