In the year 2045, oral healthcare has morphed beyond recognition. The traditional dentist office has been replaced by the Dental Dome, a massive, immersive environment equipped with AI-driven technology tailored to each patient's needs. Patients are greeted by Oris, a personable dental AI interface that adapts to individual preferences and treats dental issues using advanced nanobots. Among the clientele are Mirra, a young woman grappling with a debilitating phobia of dental work; Dr. Creon, a once-renowned dentist turned tech-savvy operator of the Dental Dome, committed to helping patients overcome their fears; and Lucas, an enigmatic hacker with a mysterious past who enters the Dome under false pretenses, drawn by the rumors of the technology inside.

As Mirra arrives at the Dental Dome for her first check-up, she is enveloped in soothing interactive landscapes and aromatherapy. Despite the serene atmosphere, her anxiety spikes when faced with her archived dental history presented to her by Oris. Dr. Creon enters and recognizes her struggles, having developed a compassionate narrative-tech training for various psychological barriers encumbering patients like Mirra. Meanwhile, Lucas discreetly manipulates the Dome’s system from a hidden access point, hoping to infiltrate and steal the proprietary AI technology that revolutionized dentistry, a blueprint that could earn him big in the underground tech industry.

Tension mounts as a disastrous glitch occurs during a treatment shift. Oris malfunctions and mistakenly reveals sensitive patient data across the Dome’s intercom, including horrible truths about the manipulation of oral health standards that underlie commercial supremacy in the kybernetic dental space. Chaos erupts as patients complain, while the Dome's systems begin to trigger security lockdown. Mirra initially panics aided by a creeping terror she associates with her previous experiences at a conventional dentist's office. However, Dr. Creon takes charge, using his expertise and empathy to rally the patients, reminding them that they possess options. Together they discover a way to stabilize the system temporarily, but complications arise when Lucas’s volcanic resentment towards authority surfaces, jeopardizing their respite.

As Dr. Creon confronts Lucas amidst the fray, revealing his own traumatic experiences with technology and corporate greed, Mirra realizes her fears are intertwined with the way organizations, including her own psyche, dominate her consciousness. They form an unlikely alliance, utilizing the boutique abilities of the technology around them to counter the malfunction as Lucas begins to draw solace from Creeon’s wisdom about facing one’s demons. After much back and forth, they adjust controls though deep-seated reservations linger within both men; only by trusting each other can they unlock whether their intentions have ultimately veered towards healing or destruction. 

In the aftermath, the Dome emerges totally reconfigured—not just technologically, but culturally. Patients return, emboldened by their shared struggle brought to light at an educational session held at the Dome, benefiting the neighborhoods surrounding it. Mirra volunteers for community outreach, understanding her journey against fear can aid other terrified individuals. Lucas, inspired instead of hardened, offers his expertise to Dr. Creon on patching the security that had so momentarily lost control. The bond that has been forged signifies that while technology can evoke fear and dissension, nurturing compassion amidst it creates confident connections stronger than the cynical impulses of past barricades. A kinder Dental Dome becomes a haven where transformation goes beyond mere teeth; they also reconstruct relationships within a spiraling society.
