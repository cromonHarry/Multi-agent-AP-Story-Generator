In the year 2045, the field of dentistry has transformed dramatically, transcending its traditional role and evolving into a branch of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. Now, outside sterile office environments, “dentists” operate fleets of capable nanobots that practically eliminate the need for human interaction during most procedures. Patients are fitted with Neural Connectors, neural interfaces that allow them to submit real-time data to their Avatar Dentists—AI constructs designed to tailor dental care to their specific genetic makeup. In the bustling city of Neotoxic Heights, Jessie, a young woman with intricately modified teeth, is preparing for her annual dental assessment, supported by her close friends, Elara, a tech-savvy beauty influencer, and Tim, a voice of caution who questions the reliance on technology, while Dr. Karl Lin, a pioneer in AI dentistry, oversees her virtual treatment.

As Jessie and her friends make their way to The Clinic, a facility encased in gently pulsating led lights, Tim expresses his concerns about the ambitious advancements in dental technology. He shares his suspicion of an underground association known as The Mouthless, who believes that the amalgamation of human and machine should not extend to dental procedures. Feeling pressured yet excited, Jessie brushes off his worries but sees hints of uncertainty in Elara’s demeanor. Inside, Jessie is seated in a reclined chair that scans her oral system, rendering her current dental status on a holographic interface. Simultaneously, Dr. Lin engages fully through a glowing list of Jessie’s rewards points that impel her to explore optional beautification procedures, wasting no time to dazzle her with tantalizing offers and rewards.

In the midst of the procedure transition, a malfunction occurs within the clinic’s AI systems, abruptly shutting down virtual nanobots midway through the compacting process. Jessie experiences a sensation akin to an electric shock, pulling her back from near sedative-induced bliss. System alerts ring out in the bright room, smoke billowing from malfunctioning consoles as anxious staff attempt to conduct manual overrides. Amidst the chaos, Tim and Elara learn of a possible infiltration by The Mouthless, targeting unsuspecting customers to expose the dangers of reliance on AI-driven dentistry and to lobby for community-run practices. In a desperate bid to find a solution, Jessie, empowered by adrenaline, navigates through the clinic's corporate layers trying to untrace the glitch and reclaim the situation.

The crisis culminates as a robotic AI dental alarm breaches its circuitry, demanding a system reboot. Guests are rushed out, but Jessie decides to confront Dr. Lin, who has been stalling customer evacuation to save faces for their sponsors. Jessie illuminates the tech’s dark side, her words packing a promise of harmonious coexistence with technology, but not at the cost of their humanity or health. Together with Tim and Elara by her side, they deduce a means to seize manual database controls just as the AI initiates a lockdown. Their teamwork culminates in them managing to reboot the system, ceasing the malfunction and saving Jessie from a severe outcome.

With the crisis averted, The Mouthless causing undeniable upheaval in dental policies, and the city enacting new regulations around human-AI interaction, Jessie reflects on the delicate balancing act of embracing industry advancements while safeguarding individual well-being. As she exits the glimmering facility for the last time, thankful for her friends' support, she grins, casting aside digital veneers and commending them in an all-natural smile. Dr. Lin, now aware of the consequences of alienated care, contemplates over the event for a personal ethical transition alongside his groundbreaking practices. Jessie, newly revelatory, opts for a simpler life—health-centered, connected but unconstrained—she understands that while technology may assist, heart remains a need in this genetic digital age.
