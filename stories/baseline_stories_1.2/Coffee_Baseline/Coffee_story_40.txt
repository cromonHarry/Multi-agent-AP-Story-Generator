In the year 2045, humanity faces a critical scarcity of natural resources, prompting drastic amendments in how people interact with food and drink. Among the casualties of climate disaster is the favored crop of the world: coffee. With the traditional bean barely surviving, scientists create an innovative synthetic blend known as "Coffine." Developed by an elite team led by Dr. Mia Park, a passionate biochemist, Coffine promises not only the rich taste of coffee but also enhanced cognitive enhancements and energy. Distinct from the memories of bitter brews in cafes of old, this artificially produced drink takes center stage in the sprawling, megacity of Neo-Tokyo, transforming every aspect of human experience—from the daily morning ritual to tech giants integrating Coffine into wearable devices. However, there is an undercurrent of revolution; some coffee purists, organized under the leadership of an eco-anarchist named Elias Sage, resist the undercurrents of synthetic drinks and are intent on restoring the integrity of natural beverages.

One day, two distinct worlds collide in that city when Ava, an inseparable friend of Mia, hides her strong disdain for Coffine. As an aspiring journalist, she is drawn to the emerging underground coffee movement led by Elias and his followers, who worship everything visceral about the coffee plant: its aroma, its growth, and—paradoxically—its scarcity. When Mia, curious about the rebellion and her best friend’s peculiar interests, pressures Ava into abandoning her journalistic pursuits for a high-stakes promotional campaign with Coffine’s producers, an atmosphere of tension suffocates their friendship. Pressurized by desperation, Ava seizes an opportunity to dive deeper into the underground movement, pursued fiercely by Miya’s ethical and flimsy grasp on scientific progress, which leads them increasingly toward conflict over personal ideals and ambition.

As the movement progresses, Ava comes to know a mysterious figure from the depths of the resistance, an enigmatic barista named Leo, whose intricate coffee blends made from rare seeds create magic and revolt grocery mats. Intrigued by both Leo's revolutionary zeal for genuine flavors and the intrigue against commercialism, Ava is torn. A good reporter, she understands bringing truth to consciousness overrides her filming bylines, but selling out boosts Mia's career against an existential backdrop. The story's stakes heighten as Mia faces backlash from corporations when research leaks expose Coffine's unintended side effects—often reducing cognitive capacity while artificially inflating initial boosts. Just as Ava pens a bursting exposé, revealing that controversy, Mia, acting under mounting corporate pressure, targets elaborate sabotage orchestrated by Elias and Leo to undermine Coffine production.

The city erupts into chaos as Mia and Ava travel the length of a divided ending: entries sprayed with mistrust about Coffine mixing both civilization and complexity create social unrest and solidarity between ideologies. In the library-shaped microcosm of full-transparency data entry systems and adapt-seeded connectivity backgrounds, defenses rally of both sides evolve without avoidance. The research sparking precedence finally challenges corporations built upon Coffine to confronts resistance, showcasing the damage done to Ceffin senior executives. Mia is then shattered, reminded that dreams of dominance are nothing without appreciation—from lovers of a more organic tradition emerges lead each movement in an effort to meet half-way in public galleries of Ideas. Meantime, courageous choices birth from burning coffee shops and production houses become radicalized bastions preserving coffee's zest.
