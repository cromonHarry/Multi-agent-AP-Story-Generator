In the year 2045, society thrives on a new generation of "thought devices," advanced technology synthesized from the remnants of smartphones. These devices are neural interfaces embedded in a cranial implant that allows users to access information, communicate, and control their environments with mere thoughts. Four main characters navigate this world: Lena, a brilliant programmer addicted to the devices, Miguel, an artist who questions the meaning of existence in a virtual uplifted space, Juno, a tech bansheen scavenging for forgotten split galaxies, and Terrence, a compliance officer tasked with ensuring citizens utilize the device responsibly. As these individuals mingle in Nexus City—a sprawling megapolis surrounded by virtual landscapes—the irreplaceable connection with their thoughts becomes a double-edged sword.

Tension builds as Lena, obsessed with maximizing her device capabilities, encounters glitches that distort her perception, feeding her paranoia. She reaches out to Miguel, whose artistic illusions now seem increasingly tangible, but he struggles with whether his art is genuine or merely a byproduct of a universal creative algorithm driven by subconscious signals from the devices. Meanwhile, Juno eavesdrops on an underground group that aims to dismantle the infrastructure enabling these thought devices. Inspired, she decides to forge an alliance, believing that relying too heavily on such technology erodes the charm of human experience, heart, and connection. As they form their ragtag troupe united by growing trepidation about the thought device's impact on freedom and identity, their latent anxieties begin to surface—each member psychologically tethered to the ungoverned potentials in their heads.

The climax ignites when Lena hacks into Nexus City’s central processing unit in a desperate bid to liberate herself from the escalating paranoia, leveraging it to encrypt essential files hosted within the brain-computer interface. The effort backfires; her latent clocking interface combines with the processing, sucking Miguel and Juno into a created neoversum—a heightened artificial space shared between fast-disappearing creativity and burgeoning chaos. Terrence, ultimately tasked with regulating upward compliance and reporting, discovers the breach midway and makes the tough decision to confront them, intending to restore societal order. Entering the neoversum, he finds himself trapped in their deluded manifestations of subconscious narratives.

In the surreal conjoined dimensions of hopes, botched dreams, and half-faded experiences, emotional reciprocity forms among this peculiar group. They form as allies, resonating beliefs about escaping societal confines that continue ensnaring nature. They battle through encapsulated memories and personalized transactions bridging migration between timeframes, only to discover that if they synch harmoniously, the gateways provide passage back to the realm of reality. In this chaotic journey, they confront not only their recursive inner demons but must also meld disparate ideas, discovering a middle ground—challenging narratives revealing the power balance life holds within/among intimate connections and thought devices.

Seeking joy embedded in the nuance of existence outside excessive reliance on technology, the team emerges from the shared experience, renewed yet grazed. They realize the beautiful paradox: imagination is unfenced even amid digital cloisters, as life blooms under the tension of fragments. Lena decides to create an app grounded in human experiences that allow users to immerse in thoughts without losing their grip on reality—an endeavor that naturally fosters interpersonal ties. The narrative crafts a resolution turned franchise of reclaiming digital innateness rooted in concept over customization; their rapport shines, abandoning traditional frameworks reflected in consciousness as they navigate this post-smartphone era collectively. In doing so, they leave splintered versions, advocating autonomy in reconciling connection and solitude.
