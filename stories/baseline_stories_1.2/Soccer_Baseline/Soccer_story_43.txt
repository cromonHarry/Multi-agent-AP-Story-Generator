In the year 2045, soccer—or "neuroball," as it has come to be known—has evolved into an exhilarating and dynamic sport that merges technology with human innovation. Set in a sprawling urban metropolis called NeoLake City, the sport now utilizes bio-sensor suits that players wear during matches, allowing their emotions and reflexes to influence their performance. The protagonists—Evelyn, a synthetic engineer, Liu, a fierce forward with aspirations of leading her team to victory, Max, a journalist disillusioned by the commercialization of the sport, and Tarek, the enigmatic captain who hides a secret history—navigate a world where personal and digital identities wiggle together both on the field and off it.

During this turbulent moment, Liu pulls off an unbelievable goal that could mark a peak in sports history, as the audience electrifies.
