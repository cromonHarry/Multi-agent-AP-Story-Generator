In the year 2045, the world operates through a ubiquitous technology called the Sentinel Network, a neural interface that allows individuals to connect directly with the digital world. Instead of using traditional passwords, people now enter their minds' passwords—five distinct emotions that unlock every piece of information, from personal data to larger societal functions. This flattened the genres of privacy and security into complex emotional algorithms, which shift each time one feels a strong emotion, making predictable hacking nearly impossible. Within this high-octane society, we meet Lena, a neuroengineer whose creativity in emotion-sequencing started the inoculation era; Harper, a scrappy anti-establishment blogger; Gav, a high-ranking government official determined to maintain control over the changing societal landscape; and Noah, Lena’s husband, who grapples with the infiltration of Sentinels into individual lives while consuming a curious and contrary blend of conspiracy theories alongside mainstream media.

Lena turns to Gav for support, but to her growing realization, he is working with the corporations, promising a promotion to him for standing guard over emotion-hackers. Confronted by betrayal, Lena finds herself caught between protecting her own family and confronting the intertwined systems of government and corporate greed. With no clear choice, Lena and Noah plot a daring retrieval raid to uncover their sister and reveal the conspiracy while working to protect individual emotional green lights across the global network.

Awakening night transforms into action; Lena teams up with Harper, whose article gains a large following leading to a revelation that becomes public—the foremost face of Sentinel Network is fraudulent, presenting pseudo-intimacy while secretly selling individuals' emotional ranges. Originally reluctant, Gav now finds himself confronted by the consequences of his decision-making within the corrupt framework.
