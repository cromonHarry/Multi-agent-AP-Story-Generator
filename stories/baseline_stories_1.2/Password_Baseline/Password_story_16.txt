In the year 2045, the concept of passwords has undergone a radical transformation; the era of forgetting complexity has been replaced by biometric integration. Humanity now relies on neuro-link devices embedded within the brain, granting residents access to their life through EEG (electroencephalography) signals. In this near-future society, securing one's identity hinges on a unique, ever-changing mental pattern each person generates. The government monitors and controls these tenets under the pretense of security and consensus, but a hacker group called “The Outliers” believes this system is oppressive. Among them is Lex, a determined coder with the mental fortitude to outsmart the government’s systems. Also in the gang are Ria, a tech-savvy engineer whose gadgets can disrupt security protocols, Jax, a former officer with inside information, and Cory, an ethical hacker who questions the core mechanics behind the systems.

The Outliers embark on a mission aimed at breaking into the Central Identity Nexus (CIN), a fortified data center housing the most potent government code—Blue Codex, the blueprint for their algorithm-driven access control system. Along their journey, Lex and Ria establish a close connection as they share ideas and revelations about the potential ramifications of the mental data in use. Under Jax’s apprehensive watch, they stall unexpectedly when discovering that rogue agents are tailing them. The group lacks a solid plan but realizes they need to infiltrate the CIN during an exhibit to leverage floor security. They prepare for this high-stakes day, molding plans with Ria's schemes and digital mischief, all while grappling with their personal motives behind relaying control back to the populace.

As opening night approaches, things take a turn for the dangerous when Ria uncovers that her father’s life dedication to the government's surveillance developed into a psychochemical trap designed to brainwash dissenters. The possibility that The Outliers might unknowingly aid the study deeply worries Ria, fueling her desire to act. Racing against time, Lex inspires determination among the group by showcasing software they've created to momentarily compile weaker data points and grant them masked identities. They launch their operation and infiltrate the exhibit, where dazzling holographs and corporate subterfuge flounder under bright light. They now possess tools to reveal overwhelming social ramifications but must circumvent identity protection tech lurking every corner.

Faced with turmoil, they scramble as blue lights flood the building, signaling the arrival of government forces tipped off by dubious allies. As the technology around them spirals out of control, Jax stages a network overload to facilitate Ria’s protocol hack, but not without sacrificing his own simulated identity to shadow-control the agents. In this significant moment of conflict, Ria helps Lex tweak the final barrier to collapse with timerunning virtues while navigating chaotic sieges. Inside, they finally retrieve the Blue Codex—a thriving manual unmasking weaknesses in the ideology that engineered personalities collectively aligned under IDs.

As dawn emerges, chaos subsides, harboring their bittersweet triumph. The Outliers cleared their name while escaping but lose Jax in the crossfire. Back at their hideout, with the Blue Codex now public, they overlook the city recovering from sleep. Together, Lex, Ria, and Cory stare ahead, envisioning future landscapes, searching for those who deem security choices insidiously predicated on one obedient system, as opposed to born resilience within deviancy. Realizing the importance of individuality supersedes blind conforming access, the struggle for freedom transcends the once-distant relationship they had with passwords—they’ve portrayed a memory-resistant realm where liberation morphs identity; “password” becomes a paralleling distinct future untethered to controls.
