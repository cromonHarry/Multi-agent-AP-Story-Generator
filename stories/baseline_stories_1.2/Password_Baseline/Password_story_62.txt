In the year 2042, society has transformed into a hyper-connected ecosystem where physical passwords have long been replaced by neural codes—personal experiences, emotions, and memories that interlink human identities with technology. Three tech-savvy friends, Jian, Luna, and Rei, navigate this world as professional "Code Weavers," hackers who specialize in crafting and breaking the psychological locks that guard individuals' memories. However, an ominous underground network known as "Data Extractors" has emerged, exploiting mined memories to manipulate and blackmail citizens. Drawn into this dangerous game, they cling to their principles as the lines between virtual identity and reality blur. Meanwhile, Zaira, a former Extractor turned whistleblower, seeks their help after encountering a shocking secret that could unravel the foundations of their society.

As Jian, Luna, and Rei mentor Zaira, they devise a plan to expose the corrupt system orchestrated by a leading corporation, Neurothink, which markets memory-wipe technology in exchange for loyalty. They gather intelligence from various linking hubs, where people anonymously exchange memories and draw support from each other's experiences. Each of the protagonists uses their unique talents: Jian, an adept programmer, reads the fluidity of memory data; Luna, a memory architect, unwinds complicated emotional knots; and Rei, a tech-savvy tactician, organizes their clandestine operations. As they delve deeper, they uncover a hidden experiment—rooted in Neurothink's origins—that tests a dangerous new system capable of overwriting an individual's core memories through the insidious Password Orb, essentially reprogramming their identity for profit.

With this revelation under heavy surveillance, stakes escalate as Jian discovers that he and his friends have inadvertently been followed. A more ruthless faction of the Extractors targets the group to secure the prototype Password Orb for themselves, leading to a visceral confrontation in the Urban Sprawl of New Kyoto, where neon lights contrast sharply against the grim realities of their illicit activities. A high-speed chase through the augmented streets ends in an intense showdown inside Neurothink’s fortress-like headquarters—a labyrinth of endless digital rooms flooded with spiraling labyrinthine data streams. Here, secrets collide in chilling brutality as memory manipulation spirals out of control, increasing tensions in a society already on edge.

Just as Zaira activates a hard code meant to collapse Neurothink’s server, they confront the Extraction leader, whose own personal motivations are revealed in an emotional conflict twisted by the exploitation of his stolen memories. In a climactic twist, Luna decides to sacrifice her connection to the Orb to save the friends she has fought alongside, unlocking the collective memories they’ve shared to mask Jian and Rei’s escape. Amid the chaos, she empowers Zaira to renegotiate the essence of forgotten histories, igniting hope of resistance against manipulative corporations. Impairment transforms into elation, as the only person affected by loss—herself—becomes a stand-in of newfound resilience.

In the aftermath, the remaining friends emerge triumphant in truth yet wearied by their battles. With the revelation of password-assisted blackmailing paved beneath a broken system, the boundaries of integrity are redefined. While they swear to develop an anonymous memory sharing haven to liberate minds from corruption, provisional repairs don't assure others' redirection. With a reckoning public that acknowledges moral ambiguities tied to both power and helplessness, they stand vigilant. Ray passionately suggests a future where every memory becomes a meaningful password against oppression, rebuilding this emerging world guided by the humility of shared experience, vowing never to forget again to embrace genuine connections rather than mere data commodification.
