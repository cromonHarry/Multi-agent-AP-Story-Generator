In the year 2045, climate change has drastically altered the planet, leading to extreme weather conditions that threaten human existence. In this world, the Umbrella Corporation has reinvented itself, no longer simply producing umbrellas against the rain, but instead selling energy-efficient, self-sustaining ‘personal weather domes’. Capable of creating a localized sustainable climate, these umbrellas shield individuals not only from vicious storms, but also from extreme temperatures and other environmental hazards. Zoe, a passionate environmental scientist, living in a flooded megacity, testifies before a corporate board that has turned deadly after several individuals are suspected of dying from helium inhalation incidents at Dome franchise locations. Zoe’s best friend Eli, always skeptical of corporate advancements, argues that such technology, while impressive, has serious ethical concerns given the manipulations in weather market.

Amidst escalating suspicions surrounding the Umbrella Corporation, two hackers—Jade and Quill—begin to uncover troubling connections between the board members and illicit trades that involve climate-controlling technologies. The two friends form an uneasy alliance; Jade drives on instinct and emotions while Quill is meticulous and highly analytical. They discover that some of the 'weather domes' have been weaponized to induce selective disasters for corporate gain, thereby increasing their market dominance. Simultaneously, the city is wracked by unprecedented and desperate protests against price gouging by the corporation, framing an opportunity for meaningful change.

Zoe, realizing the implications of the knowledge she has regarding the corporation, grapples with her professional duty against her moral compass. Convinced to embark on a mission to expose the company, Zoe connections with Jade and Quill, who are in possession of data recovered from secretive board meetings. Their research leads them to plan a hacking operation during the high-profile Umbrella conference where the company intends to reveal the newest iterations of their dome technology. Tension rises when it becomes apparent that the abilities of the technology extend beyond simple climate control and into invasive surveillance, heightening the group's urgency.

As the conference begins, the team goes into high gear, splitting into different roles—Zoe devising a misinformation strategy to publicly redirect attention while Jade and Quill breach the company’s security systems. The conference is ignited by a scripted presentation, but the friends’ careful strategies begin to unravel the truth as shocking data emerges directly on stage. The energy of skepticism in the audience transforms into chaos as attendees grapple with the criminal implications of their investments and how they’re all duped into complicity through passive consumerism.

With tensions at a boiling point, media coverage explodes, with journalists converging on the scene, forcing the corporation into emergency meetings and legal action. In the fallout, widespread public outcry leads to regulatory reform for corporate practices around environmental manipulation. The group stands on stage drenched in spotlight, unsure of their fate, but they unveil the truth of the Umbrella’s corruption. Zoe, Eli, Jade, and Quill form a new coalition dedicated to reshaping technology in environmental ethics, promising to root out corporate greed in naming their initiative 'New Shelter'. While the world continues to fight against climate catastrophe, these pioneers evolve into symbols of hope, carrying forward the gathering storm.
