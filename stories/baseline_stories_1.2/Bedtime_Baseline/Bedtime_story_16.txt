In the year 2045, humanity thrives amidst advanced technology that stretches harmful productivity beyond reason, leaving little room for natural rest. "Bedtime" has transformed into a virtual reality platform known as the SleepSphere, where individuals plug in their minds to experience perfect rest curated by sophisticated AIs, tuned to individual preferences and life rhythms. Ava, a sleep-averse tech repair specialist, has made a comfortable life for herself in a bustling mega-city but is haunted by persistent insomnia. She works alongside her ever-skeptical best friend, Ben, a behavioral psychologist who questions the wisdom of immersing life in such escapism. With them is Lila, a SleepSphere technician who seems to be hiding secrets about tech side effects, and Dom, a charming and mysterious corporate executive involved in the future of SleepSphere, who believes in its necessity for societal order.

As Ava’s condition worsens, her emotional resistance diminishes, leading her to reluctantly engage with the SleepSphere. All around her, technocrats glorify the platform as a savior from chaos, while others develop fatal dependencies that ruin their waking lives. Despite degrading mental chatter and flickering memories plaguing her attempts to initiate the experience, Ava persistently tries to find the balance of a real-life connection without escaping completely into cyberspace. Ben fervently warns her about the addictive nature of this seeming ease and journeys into sleep studies to search for dependable solutions—bettering the real-life foundation of human and relational understanding before all is subsumed in technology. Lila, understanding both the romance and the peril, expresses quiet concern over the ethics of SleepSphere while revealing her missing brother had a deep personal connection to the program—one that unnervingly echoes hollow in warmth.

The cities fall often into lines of luminous energy strands, lives outlined in a quiet madness, contrasting Ava and Ben's daily struggle against the hypnotic allure pulling in wait. The trials accelerate their world spiraling into uncertainty, compiling strange reports surfacing through to people's mental health degradation after using the Sphere. The plot thickens when a series of unexplained wakeful massacres plague the restless few who refuse to join. Fueled by rising concern and an unmistakable intention between Ava and Ben to find the odd bump in the situation, they decide to infiltrate the corporate side of the SleepSphere with Lila’s insider knowledge and Dom guiding them through finding the nexus. Ava, unsuspectingly, realizes there’s something darker; the tech, harboring sensations and emotions altered for profit, peaks into manipulation marked far deeper than any functionality.

Holding their breath, the four enter into the depths of SleepSphere, witnessing the artificial confluence of dreams and menacing actual designs on neural modification—a collapsing façade promising full satisfaction careless of mental systems. Culminating in an explosive confrontation, paranoia ensues as minds veer toward darkness; they race against time to unveil the truth before implantation wipes the capacity for choice clean. The stakes destabilize and blood both familial and corporate runs thin after unkept revelations emerge. As things slip from hatred, old memories exchanged spark life in collective ground—they realize that their dreams must not come from good constructs but their own perceptive hearts, forming the mantra of risk, truth, intimacy and complexity.

Freed from the SleepSphere’s balm, the group takes a stand to reclaim their nighttime and each other. They campaign against unhealthy reliance on artificial guides-owned smartphones buffering the buried heart of wellness—a collective decision forging connection over quick fixes. Ava new-found clarity brings ideas for tangible support systems along with Ben's aptitude for relational artistry; and exceeding Lila’s determination pushes ballistic Media outlets to re-evaluate as darkness illuminates brilliant appointments brimming with hearth back in human bedrooms. United, all four shape a bye-line that resonates: sounding festive whispers—real-life bedtimes illuminated softly in honesty commence once more. After diving therein fearlessly until dusk-like equilibrium crowned the visions of human motifs back again upon elaborate dotting blankets—every star unintend endows something great cradled against wanton sleep.
