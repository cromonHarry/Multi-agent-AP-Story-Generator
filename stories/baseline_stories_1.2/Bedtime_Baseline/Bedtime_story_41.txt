In the year 2045, "Bedtime" is no longer a simple ritual of winding down and sleeping. Society has evolved into a technologically dominated world where sleep is considered an obsolete trait. The SleepTech Corporation, a mega-conglomerate, introduced innovative sleep capsules that promise peak physical and mental health through incredibly efficient nanotechnology without requiring traditional sleep. Four young adults—Nova, a rebellious biomedical engineer; Zeph, her skeptical childhood friend; Callum, a SleepTech elite programmer; and Mia, an overachieving law student—find themselves enmeshed in this new world. For them, bedtime consists primarily of bio-hacks and augmented dreaming sessions, allowing them to achieve consciousness-controlled sleep features designed to maximize productivity. However, Nova, unlike her peers, begins questioning the ethical and mental implications of their sleepless existence.

One day, during a brainstorming session aimed at enhancing the SleepTech dream interface, Nova uncovers distressing data indicating a correlation between the company's capsules and a rise in neurological disorders among users. Torn between revealing her findings and fearing the company’s substantial influence, Nova confides in Zeph. While zealous in belief about their stemwork interpretations, Zeph reminds her of the societal consequences of opposing SleepTech. In a moment of inspiration, Nova suggests an underground experiment by resuming natural sleep, interspersed with recorded bedtime stories in an attempt to trick themselves back into the deeper aspects of rest. Undeterred by the risk, the group agrees; they are committed to uncovering the truth and reviving the concept of natural sleep.

As they delve into the experimental regime, the barriers built by SleepTech begin to weaken. Nova's creativity flourishes, and her subconscious explorations through collective dream sessions lead her to surreal revelations; hidden memories of cherished moments from their childhood begin to resurface. However, the newfound bond among the friends fosters not only understanding but also worsening health effects from dispelling the capsules. Zeph experiences crippling fatigue, almost succumbing to protective AI patrols hired by SleepTech to hunt down sleepers trying to breach their system. Mia juggles her case against a corporate collaboration while aligning herself with her friends. Each character erupts in conflicts between allegiance and autonomy as the balance shifts throughout their experiences navigating their dreams.  

The tension reaches a climax when Nova ventures into the heart of the augmented dream programming and uncovers a monstrous scheme: SleepTech has been harvesting not just prospective customers but personal data straight from the emotional depths of their unused dreams, feeding it into a controlled, market-driven cycle of subliminal advertising powered by subconscious influence. A monumental decision lies before Nova and her friends; they have the potential to leak this catastrophe to the world but place their lives on the line with the prospect of revenge from SleepTech. They execute a plan under the veil of night, broadcasting evidence that reveals the corporate manipulation of sleep cycles to the entire populace.

As news spreads and public uproar ensues, the implications rend SleepTech asunder. The group becomes reluctant heroes, celebrated by adoring fans, yet they endure ongoing trauma from experiences too intense to bear fully. As the authorities dive deeper into the corporation's unethical practices, the devastating wreckage drags moral ambiguities into punishing alignments. Surrounded by understanding supporters, Nova finds comfort in newly sharing vulnerable sleep narratives as they embolden to fight against many remnants of extreme efficiency-centric culture. Through elements of rest, community, and engagement with personal psyche, they pave a way back to traditional “Bedtime”—one permitting exploration, authenticity, and profound humanity as they rewrite what it means to dream.
