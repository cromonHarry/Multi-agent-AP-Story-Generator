In the year 2042, societal norms around sleep have changed dramatically due to the emergence of SleepSync technology, a device that seamlessly melds consciousness with dream environments. Most people no longer see bedtime as a pause but rather a continuation of life in altered realities. In this world, families struggle to maintain their human connections, often lost in personalized dreamscapes that cater to their wildest fantasies. We meet four characters: Ava, a powerful SleepSync engineer; Jonah, her curious teenage son overwhelmed by dreams; Percy, Ava's elderly father haunted by a past when dreams were much simpler; and Lila, Jonah's friend who experiences nightmares from SleepSync malfunctions that bring hidden fears to life.

As SleepSync technology becomes more integrated into daily routines, Ava finds herself preoccupied with her work, often leaving Jonah to navigate the dream world alone. Oscar Travers, the bold CEO of a rival SleepSync corporation, initiates a campaign promising faster and more potent dream experiences, showing direct advertisements that create a frenzy among users to upgrade their systems. Struggling with pressure and societal expectations, Jonah estranges himself from Lila, who is becoming increasingly paranoid about her altered sleep state, worrying she's risking her sense of reality. Percy, however, benches himself in front of old films about genuine human experiences—the fundamental emotion of longing, resilience, and connection—all urging his family to remember that there is value in authentic living.

The tide turns when a massive SleepSync malfunction crash-lands an entire city block into chaos, triggering violent warnings of withdrawal among diehard enthusiasts, leaving many vulnerable and disconnected. Unable to resonate with others in their dreams, Jonah finds himself trapped in a web of insecurities, running into Lila, who reveals that her nightmares are symptomatical of their over-plugged lives. Meanwhile, Ava faces relentless pressure at work, pushing her own family deeper into desolation. As Earth teeters on the brink of SleepSync addiction and societal collapse, Jonah feels the weight of his loneliness and seeks the wisdom of his grandfather Percy, prompting a familial intervention to detach from technology that has consumed their lives.

In an effort to save Jonah and themselves from spiraling deeper into an unreality, the four join forces to retaliate against SleepSync's allure, setting out to create a village-wide awareness campaign. With persuasive courage from Ava and nostalgic storytelling from Percy, they visit once-met friends in the community, calling for nights without the device—actual bedtime stories under the stars, where connection and love can bloom anew. With dreams interrupted and their reliance crumbling, families band together to strip SleepSync of its power and relive quaint rituals from happier times when bedtime signified comfort, trust, and human touch, intertwined with adventure rather than withdrawal.

Gradually, waves of regeneration begin washing over their community as joyful reunions spark and growth instances erupt. As the SleepSync systems are unequipped and public spaces leverage social gatherings filled with applause and laughter ride through once-ghostlike apartments, real and vivid interactions burgeon again. In this inspiring thrall of belonging, Jonah rekindles his relationship with Lila through far more exhilarating timeframe games, drawing forth warmth from a common challenge, while Ava and Percy taint the endless weight of pessimism with shared humanity through poetry, rebuilding family and community layers. They emerge definitively wiser, having salvaged the essence of who they are—a tender envelope nudging each other towards suitable "bedtime," different now—grounded in authentic ties rather than dream ghosts that would redefine what it means to wake up and unite.
