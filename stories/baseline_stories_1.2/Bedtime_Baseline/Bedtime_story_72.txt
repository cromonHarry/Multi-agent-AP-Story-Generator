In a world where every moment is optimized for productivity, sleep has been transformed into a commodity. The smart-consciousness network, a widespread melding of AI and human consciousness, governs the rhythms of daily life, mandating enforced productivity regimes balanced by regimented sleep cycles known as "Bedspace". Individuals have taken to booking their sleep hours like flights, turning rest into competitive social capital. Lea, an overworked corporate strategist, Kira, her rebellious younger brother designing illegal party apps, Viktor, a weary sleep technician, and Madeline, an elusive influencer selling 'dream experiences' to elite clients form the crux of this story. Their lives intertwine under the oppressive clock of schedule-bound bedtimes, tick-tocking towards potential liberation or digital subjugation.

Frustrated by her overloaded work-life under the stringent Bedspace regulations, Lea feels trapped in a ceaseless loop of capitalistic demands and terrorized by anxiety-dreams when she finally sleeps. At the same time, Kira becomes entangled with clandestine after-hours parties that ignite revolutions of consciousness through illicit tech. The excitement is palpable, but hidden dangers from the police drones monitoring deviation from set routines loom in the shadows. Meanwhile, Viktor discovers anomalies in sleep data retrieval; he’s witnessing unsettling declines in deep sleep cycles as people become more reliant on the ideal skeletal sleep trackers, obliviously fueling the cycle of dependency. As Madeline’s business of alternate ‘dreamscapes’ becomes more popular among the public elite, disturbing echoes of hive-mind hypnosis surface, triggering insights about who truly controls their dream states.

As Lea investigates Kira's underground scene to help her brother while navigating the chaos at her high-stakes job, she crosses paths with Viktor. With his software capabilities, he lends her crucial insights on reversing individual sleep dependency algorithms. They hatch a reckless plan: to divert attention from Madeline’s Dreamscape Clear a controversial mind-control platform mashed into mainstream media’s bedtime narratives. When they create a prototype software app designed to re-harmonize the body’s natural circadian rhythm disrupted by the oppressive timeline, everything collides. An uptick in disruption tendencies sends alarms blaring through the Justice Division enforcing iron laws on scheduled rest, forcing them into a precinct of surveillance while Kira assembles supporters with streams of calls to action brimming across cyberspace.

Swiftly approaching the apex in their interconnected predicaments, Kira triggers a massive expose with the help of reluctant tech pals to crash Madeline’s systems during an elite showcase streamed to hundreds of thousands. Millions face the stark truth of Matt’s eerie mass monitoring while Viktor pushes to watch their dream states wrested free from external gaze and redirects the adrenaline to Heinous algorithms plotting obsolescence. Scarily, dreams of possibility collide; during the crises’ crescendo, power fluctuates as Jess—Madeline’s manipulative Kou weighted partner aiming to fortify restrictions—steps into the foundations they’ve encased line after line of hope, removing the loads of Amenisms shrouded in white-washed lucidity prison trappings.

In the aftermath, broadcasting awareness reshapes the societal landscape towards individuality and empowerment once again, where ‘Bedspace’ reimagines a community of dreamers reclaiming autonomy and sacred minutes of twilight posed against racing threads of social mistrust. Lea confronts her waning anxiety, moving towards strength created through solidarity, while Kira steps wider walks of civic duty bruised but resilient—creating experimental communities cherishing fragile experiences of sleep devoid of regulation. Viktor, admired now as a visionary reformist, clashes periodically with Jess's designs, but collaboration whets seeds of change flourish in emerging personalized sectors, and Madeline risks folding dreams anew birthed in a free-bound hope amongst untangible past convolutes. Their tales become embraced nationwide; those shimmering wisps of unforgotten systems disproved eatingly beckon beyond legacies long imposed, carrying along 'Bedtime' transformed forever.
