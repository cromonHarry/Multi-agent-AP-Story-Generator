In the year 2045, the tradition of bedtime has transformed into a data-driven series of activities aimed at enhancing cognitive function during sleep. Society has adopted the revolutionary SleepRegimen pods, where any individual can customize their sleeping experience through virtual environments and biofeedback sensors. Ava, a dedicated SleepTech engineer, has perfected these pods to specialize in emotionally tailored story experiences, rooted in deep learning algorithms. Meanwhile, her brother, Finn, adapts to this landscape reluctantly, clinging to the remnants of traditional bedtime. Despite his skepticism, he reluctantly agrees to test his sister’s latest invention before a major launch, fascinated and resentful in equal measure. Alongside them are Tariq, their hyperactive and analytical friend, who integrates data into every part of his life, and Liza, an artistic dreamer who finds solace in the last remnants of old-world rituals.

As Ava prepares for the launch, friends gather as testers to unlock the hidden potential of their state-of-the-art SleepRegimen. She invites Finn to experience her enhancements, minimizing his worries about both the technology and corporate pressures in the fast-paced universe around them. Tariq decides to push the limits, eager to document and record every potential change in cognitive function while Liza shows signs of resistance, claiming that sometimes, memories can only be spontaneous and cannot be manufactured by machines. Their discussions grow lively, blending excitement with a slight hesitance; the lines blur between nostalgia for traditions no longer practiced and the allure of technological advancement. Soon, they settle in each of their pods as they prepare for what is initially perceived as yet another ordinary sleep cycle. 

The central core of the evening arrives when the experiments commence inside the larger-than-life virtual space created by Ava’s coding. As customized narratives unfold around each individual—fantasy worlds for Liza, forgotten lecturing moments for Tariq, and unusual movie genres made emotionally rich for Finn—lights flicker, and the stimulation from Finn's pod takes an unexpected turn. Without warning, a glitch veers their tranquil habitation into a surreal chaos, where memories transform ominously sinister. The familiar fairy tale theme for Liza ignites nightmare sequences, while the nostalgia fulfilling story genres crumble into emotional disarray for Finn, uncovering resentment toward changing customs. As Tariq wrestles with statistics and complication, the existential horror overshadows their digital sanctuary, spiraling the supportive group into chaos.

In their struggle for escapes, they confront their subconscious fears, representing misgivings about progress versus tradition as answers lay hidden along the edge of their thoughts. Fractions of their past seep into place, revealing vulnerabilities they desperately grapple with awake. Tension peaks as mustered emotional turmoil clashing with technology reaches vultures circling on darker skies. Just when hopelessness settles, genuine compassion begins to mend these bonds. Loose threads of friendship form a fabric strong enough for them, connecting memories and emotions steeped in shared experiences over visions molded by technology. They understand together that while advancements in SleepRegimen improve function, love and understanding remain surpassingly human. 

As the pod's alarm resets into a newfound harmony, each character awakens in the early morning light, challenged yet infinitely messaged by their dreams. With clearer minds, Ava takes steps to iron out the technical environment creating anomalies while pledging to work on returning lost feelings of authenticity to their personalized frameworks. Finn imparts that sleep is to be cherished, an aspect less absorbable by efficient programming. Liza threads conversion to reclaiming art in storytelling’s imaginative nature, and Tariq ponders descriptive patterns for bringing empathetic algorithms. No longer entrenched in their respective frustrations and opinions about bedtime, they emerge with profound bonds, seeking therapeutic connections and inhaling fresh experiences endowed with meaning amidst advancing technology. Their dose of newfound respect for bedtime—ethereal, tradition, and love alike—sends them budding dreams and colorful futures anew.
