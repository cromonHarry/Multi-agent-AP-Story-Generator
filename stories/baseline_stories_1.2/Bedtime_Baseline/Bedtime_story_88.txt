In the year 2045, society has evolved into one where sleep is more luxury than necessity, transformed by advanced biotechnology that allows humans to function with minimal rest. The Sleep Compliance Initiative, a government program, has pioneered a unique device known as the Sleep Synthesizer, which promises deep restorative sleep in just a fraction of the traditional time. Four friends—Maya, an ethical hacker striving to expose government secrets; Theo, a tech enthusiast and upscale Sleep Synthesizer user; Linh, a sleep therapist frustrated with the erosion of natural sleep cycles; and Aiden, a popular vlogger who's gained fame for promoting sleep optimization—navigate through a world that fetishizes efficiency over restfulness. As they gather for their weekly game night, conversations swirl around pressing topics: the resurgence of sleep-related disorders and growing unease about the government’s desire for a society fully wired towards productivity.

Maya introduces the group to newfound information regarding the possible psychological repercussions of the synthetic sleep technology. She reveals her suspicions surrounding a dark side to the company's brilliant marketing—alarming cases of dependency, sleep paralysis, and addiction to the gizmos which drain emotional bandwidth and alter basic behavioral patterns. Intrigued yet skeptical, the others initially dismiss her claims, but lend an ear as she outlines a plan to infiltrate the Sleep Compliance Initiative's mainframe that night to extract unfiltered data. The tension escalates as Maya struggles with her conscience; she feels compelled to act on behalf of those who’ve suffered unknowingly from over-reliance on the Synthesizers, yet fears losing her friends should her risks lead to legal troubles.

As they execute the sole portion of the plan involving infiltration, Maya generates a delay with her computer skills while Theo unwittingly activates an alarm. The trio hears loud sirens wailing through the cityscape, while Aiden records the live feedback for his viewers, exclaiming the unintended turn of events. Altogether, they help each other navigate their surroundings to escape the initial panic sparked by the flashing lights and rushing security. Just as they hit a seemingly secure location within an abandoned building that once served as a community center, Linh offers critical insights she memorized from therapeutic manuals, negotiating the challenge of confusion forming among them, reinforcing their relevance to an honest culture, and managing the anxieties running rampant throughout the group.

Tensions climax when they unexpectedly find themselves cornered by security personnel who arrived on-site after triggered alarms. As potential consequences wrap heavy around their shoulders, Aiden puts his social media influence to use, broadcasting an impromptu message urging viewers to seek clarity for their loved ones. In a twist of humor laced with genuine emotion, Linh indulges in sincerity, relaying her years of therapy designed around the significance of true rest. And in that tense moment, a revelation awakens within each of them—through story, they can individualize sleep and the significance it held, a Forte that’s been wildly toyed with, breaking down façades woven by corrupted tales about productivity.

In the aftermath, the friends successfully record and secure the data, shedding light on citizens who have suffered under the Sleep Compliance Initiative’s watchful guise. Their attempts reintroduce the world to traditional sleep philosophies, unearthing segments of the population begging for restoration and a retreat from fabricated slumber. Maya becomes an underground activist, speaking at events pushing for nighttime restoration policies, while Linh gains support for natural sleep clinic endeavors where empathetic treatments reclaim humanity in rest. Theo eventually endorses devices aimed at balancing technology with individual sleep needs, as Aiden’s channel touts the human stories sparked by their fight. In redefining “bedtime,” the friends embrace a future resolute in honoring humanity's inherent rhythms against all odds.
