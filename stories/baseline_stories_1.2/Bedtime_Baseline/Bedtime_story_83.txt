In the year 2045, the concept of “bedtime” has transformed dramatically, shaped by technological advancements that cater to health and efficiency. In this future world, artificial intelligence manages people’s sleeping schedules through biofeedback monitors integrated into everyday clothing. Each person’s bedtime is optimized for health, work productivity, and even social interactions, which leads to a society that champions 24/7 productivity. Marla, a sleep coach who specializes in “circadian alignment” therapy, strives to help patients achieve the perfect balance of rest. She befriends Geordy, a rebellious teenager who resists the system and words only of the joy of staying awake all night to explore the wonders of the world outside the structured periods dictated by technology.

One fateful evening, Marla is called to a clinic where Geordy has checked in after experiencing significant insomnia. Here, she meets Dr. Lennox, an ambitious physician and advocate of forced sleep treatments through docile brain implants and Eli, a young engineer entwined with Geordy’s journey who dreams of building technology that restores natural sleep patterns. Marla grows increasingly concerned about the mental health implications of these technological mandates and forms an unlikely coalition with her new friends. Together, they investigate a rise in depression and social disconnect stemming from the manic commotion of constant wakefulness, an issue the authorities continue to downplay.

As they delve deeper, the group uncovers hidden details about an experimental project called "Soma Matrix," an encrypted government initiative aimed at vaccine-induced sleep-management strategies that would fundamentally erase the concept of voluntary bedtime entirely. Geordy skillfully hacks into Mr. Halston’s network—a high-ranking engineer behind the Soma Matrix project—with Eli's genius guiding him. In the process, they unearth files disclosing how the voluntary sleep enhancement tech would ultimately monopolize those with insomnia to subscribe to predictive power, leading to a bleak scenario where “bedtime hours” would strip citizens of their autonomy and crucial mind functions.

In a last-ditch effort to save their personal lives and provoke change, Marla orchestrates a “rave against sleep” event, challenging the brainwaves designed by technological overlords during an open, all-night protest within the city center. They broadcast recordings of healthy adults sharing how societal pressures for perpetual productivity stifled their youth. Though police enforcement attempts to help eradicate rebellion through installations of tranquilizing drones, a romantic moment blossoms between Geordy and Eli as they devise a plan to outsmart the technology with systems that promote natural sleep cycles, generating disrupted patterns that cant’ silence the dissent. Careful planning, high spirits, and unwavering determination surge as Marla rallies the crowd, offering the untethered freedom of genuine bedtime decisions to reclaim what has always been humankind's right.

While the dust of the night’s chaos settles, the unmistakable demand for autonomy sweeps through the streets. News of civil discontent spreads like wildfire; people across the country begin speaking out against oppressive sleep schedules imposed by the ruling faction of technocrats. Amid the societal upheaval, Marla sees a spark ignited in Geordy that reflects improvement in life and autonomy—his newfound interest in balance indicating that collectivism can often reawaken true agency. Inspired, Geordy decides to take on a leadership role aimed at reconnecting inter-dependent communities, while Eli pushes to develop tech that respects human needs, drawing ideals from crowd engagement. The essential notion of bedtime transforms from a mere nightly disappointment into a rallying guidance allowing its held essence of safety, freedom, and heartfelt pause—once more entrusted to the people.
