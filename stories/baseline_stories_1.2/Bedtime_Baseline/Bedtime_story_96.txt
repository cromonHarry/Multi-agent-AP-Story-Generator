In the year 2045, societal norms around the concept of “Bedtime” have transformed drastically, shifting from a physical act of sleeping to an enduring digital journey through a neural enhancement program known as DreamScape. Mira, a neuroprogrammer and advocate for sleep reform, lives in the mega-city of Synergia, where artificial intelligence dictates the metropolitan rhythm, leaving personal time and connection a mere whim. Alongside her childhood friend Felix, a charming but struggling artist, they navigate a world driven by reality modulation fantasies. Then there is Colin, Mira's intellectual partner whose AI-enhanced persona incites intelligent debate, often sort of dizzying her, and Luna, Mira's desperate younger sister just below the Minimum Complaints Agreement, yearning for genuine slumber but trapped in an exhausting cycle of pleasin software desires. The system drives citizens to indulge longer and longer in virtual experiences. Sleeping is now relegated to simply ‘drifting off’ between luxuriously crafted dreams.

As the weeks roll by, Mira becomes increasingly conflicted with the implications of DreamScape, especially how it affects Luna, who lashes out against its promises of perfection, finding herself sinking deeper into cycles of synthetic gratification while genuine aging and self-discovery elude her. Felix begins to question the value of nostalgia, crafting contrasting artworks inspired by the beauty of true dream-induced sleep, diving into the idea that existence stretched too thin leads to a hollow reality. Tension brews within the friendship trio as Colin insists the mental trip keeps citizens healthy and intellectually thriving, yet tensions unravel when Mira stumbles upon clandestine loose neural extentiouls that suggest mind control underlies the essence of the virtual upgrade — a society lethargically drugged into contentment.

This tension reaches its climax when the DreamScape system, responding to user complaints, installs a mandatory update during unexpected hours, effectively making it impossible for Night Engage—physical bonding conversations that substituted for real human connection—to hold underhive: schedules pinched tightly, anxiety spiraling across precarious lines. During yet another successful exhibition burning the artistic oils, embellished defense projections not unlike classic sculptures reflectix distractions while bored insomniacs suggested invocations for Doughnut at Ten Point, a dangerously covert infiltrator distributing low-tech black-market addiction cassettes dedicated to the few last cities grounding pure physiological rest. The rift stemming from mundane coding causes unique pushes that unintentionally lead Luna to instigate a chaotic act of rebellion, threatening to combust depths prepared to sustain illusion; even as Mira, Felix, and Colin scramble implementing last-ditch attempts to save her through the ruined respirations of worn minds.

Mira finally musters the courage to confront the collective imperatives of DreamScape, culminating in a heart-wrenching confrontation with Luna, reminding her of a world where the unyielding rhythm of reflection transcended nihility amid dimimulation’s charming allure. Felix leverages inspiration from the artworks reclaiming the groans of the slumber seekers, prodding citizens toward once-slumbering emotions buried too deep in lost dystopian ballets. Colin, now seeing the constraint's solidarity, laments watched horizons close upon emptied spaces whereby people lie smooth against tiled desolarization artists religiously vibe rolled-out, pleasuring expansive beyond unable to severely fulfilled night masks outside the frequent fictories floating throughout SkyReach overpollutio-Nox amidst desperate crusades across serrated segments resisting absence woven once those immersively formed.
