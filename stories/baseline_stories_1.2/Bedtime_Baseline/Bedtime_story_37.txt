In the year 2042, society has evolved to a point where sleep, once a simple necessity, has turned into a commodified experience orchestrated by advanced technology. Tero lives in Neo-Luna, a city dominated by skyscrapers that pulsate with soft, glowing lights. People no longer sleep in the traditional sense; instead, they participate in SleepSync, an immersive virtual reality system that promises to enhance sleep quality and motivations for living. Tero, a sleep engineer, has devoted his life to perfecting this technology alongside his mentor, Dr. Elara Jin, who is increasingly becoming puzzled by the ethical implications of manipulating human consciousness. Meanwhile, Jim, a skeptical journalist, and Tero’s younger sister, Leni, resent the way life has become a mechanized chore, yearning for the lost romanticism of bedtime stories and the fading sensation of slipping into a woolen blanket.

With distaste for artificial stimuli, Leni sneaks into Tero’s lab one night, keen on sharing homemade lullabies and digital children’s stories with Tero instead of SleepSync. Simultaneously, remnants of a rebellion beneath Neo-Luna arise, questioning the cost of their sleep-driven culture and insisting that true rest comes from the intrinsic human ability to dream freely. Some residents advocate for rediscovering natural, unmediated sleep, raising alarms that the constant need for engineered bedtime harmonies could lead to a terrifying reality: people losing the ability to dream at all. Tero becomes conflicted between pursuing innovation and listening to Leni, as whispers of the rebellion challenge the system he helps perpetuate.

The climax occurs on the eve of a significant company announcement aimed at launching an even more intense SleepSync upgrade clad in flashy marketing, pitched primarily towards vulnerable families. On that same night, Leni and the rebellion decide to broadcast a peaceful protest, fully equipped with tattered bedtime books and voices echoing lullabies, through a feed that hijacks the sleep entrepreneur’s exclusive event. Tero is torn as he stands with collector sleep waves for the big reveal, debating whether to inform Dr. Elara or join Leni in rediscovering heartfelt dreams and true sleep that existed untouched by technology—context oblivious of advancing progress.

As the broadcast interrupts the marketing show, chaos ensues. Tero finally makes a choice, stepping away from the neural interface and urging the audience—mostly caught in soothing, simulated states—to wake up and experience their own stories. Iben hates what their lives have become, waking to the cracked edges of a cableless reality amidst anger and confusion. From this collective moment of clarity, resistance emerges with Leni at its forefront, advocating for a potential new beginning where humanity can reclaim bedtime and allow the inherently distractible mind space needed to rest properly.

In the aftermath, Neo-Luna awakens, battling echoing shadows of past doubts but embracing a novel dream-making freedom where storytelling and reflection breathe fresh life into bedtime itself. Tero and Elara realize their responsibility and support Leni’s aspirations, helping to return nature, ideas, and regrets into the space between sleep and each dawn. With resistance strong, humanity’s embrace of authentic sleep burgeons; ideas mesh and evolve through soothing rhythms and warm lights, encouraging children and adults alike to endure more than predetermined numbness—from hard interfaces to boundless imaginings that hearten the embrace of true, timeless bedtimes.
