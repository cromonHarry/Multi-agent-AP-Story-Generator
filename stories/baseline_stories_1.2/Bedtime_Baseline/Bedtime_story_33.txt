In the not-so-distant future, society has drastically transformed around the concept of sleep, or rather, the re-engineered ritual of "Bedtime." Advances in neurotechnology and virtual reality have allowed for a world where falling asleep is no longer a chore, but a hyper-personalized experience blending instructional sleep techniques with immersive dreams customized to an individual’s desires. The Sleep Regulation Agency (SRA) monitors every citizen's sleep patterns, encouraging a million unique Bedtime routines, ensuring that productivity remains at an all-time high. Juniper, an idealistic child behavioral psychologist, devises a gentle approach to fixing sleep issues. Mack is a cynical tech engineer who of late has grown wary of the SRA’s authoritarian grip on people's lives, wondering how genuine a human experience can be when orchestrated by code. Anva, his childhood friend turned ecology activist, believes there are environmental costs to creating synthetic dreams. Then there’s Theo, Juniper’s adventurous 12-year-old nephew, who struggles to fit into society with his vivid, uncontrolled dreams.

As bedtime for today approaches, Mack takes action to confront the ever-tightening leash that the SRA holds over personal lives through bedtime technology. While packing for an underground resistance meeting that seeks to expose the harmful consequences of the overmedicated sleepy demographics, he receives a text from Juniper urging him to reconsider. The day culminates in an escalating debate between the friends; Mack argues that people have become mere widgets of productivity devoid of authentic self-expression, while Juniper believes that controlling sleep leads to a happier, less anxious society. An unsettling truth surfaces when Theo shares a trio of unsettlingly trippy dream experiences with Anva at dinner. A profound gap widths between child's necessity for dreams beyond control and a moral gray-area economy that erases natural sleep in pursuit of benefits.

Driving toward their underground meeting that night, chaos erupts when a SRA surveillance drone identifies their convoy. Mack narrowly escapes but loses control of his autonomous vehicle, leaving him traumatized and paranoid as he takes refuge in an abandoned metro tunnel. Meanwhile, Juniper reluctantly expands her work to salvage Theo’s troubling dreams, using her position within the SRA to find data that hasn’t been edited to fit government-controlled narratives. Anva, propelled by June's plea for help, discovers bonds in sharing dreams can be found in company and wrestling against the matrix of tech interference. Tensions mount as it dawns upon them all that The SRA relays drones as bed police congregating in curious, laughter for monitoring.

The boiling point arrives when Theo joins Anva underground. Using sheer determination, they, alongside newfound allies who lack SRA vigilance, program a dream antidote. However, when pushed to the limits, Juniper must choose. Remain within the sleep industry structure she now can influence or join the resistance, confronting Mack and their long-buried tensions to steer the momentum of freedom dreams. A daring divergence is made, and Juniper fires a device across the twilit surface - signaling the SRA deep surveillance network through sound frequency and glitch-activated drone foes scrambling to regain control.

Ultimately, amidst a backdrop of bureaucratic upheaval, hope entwines junipers and starts brewing. Armed with firsthand narratives of disenchanted classmates showcasing their dreams, Theo can teach children the course of loss and rejuvenation. For Anva and Mack, present pain morphs into terse ambition for alteration in sustainable living outside harsh regulations. Where “Bedtime” once operated at the mercy of calculation, it could once more take off under a singular open sun connecting dopamine laughs of unity on inspired pillowstruck beds, finally sending the power back to dreams where they belong.
