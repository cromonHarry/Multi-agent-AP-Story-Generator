In the year 2045, the concept of “Bedtime” has become entirely unrecognizable from its traditional roots. In a society dominated by neurotechnology, sleep is no longer mandatory; instead, individuals consume custom-designed dreams through neural interfaces that control their subconscious. Young Ethan, a restless teenage boy, struggles with anxiety, barely sleeping at all. His mother, Mira, is a tech researcher working on improving dream experiences for therapeutic purposes. She is dedicated to perfecting the Elysium Capsule—a device that allows users to experience enhanced dreaming. Then there’s Ava, Ethan’s sister, who indulges in several extreme dream experiences that come at a hefty price in both money and mental health. Lastly, Nikko, their neighbor and local dream architect, believes that true relaxation should be achieved without the crutch of technology.

As the story unfolds, Ethan's relationship with sleep becomes increasingly strained. During a family dinner, both his sister's erratic behavior and his mother's fervor for the Elysium Capsule set a stark contrast with his simple desire for a restful night's sleep. After several sleepless nights studying the ramifications of advanced dreaming on mental health, Ethan decides he wants to experience a real dream without the interference of technology, feeling suffocated by the pressure each night to indulge in designer dreams. Thus, he forges a secret pact with Nikko, who has long suspected that meaningful dreams hold value beyond manufactured fantasy. Together, they devise a plan to recreate what real dreams feel like by isolating themselves from all technology—including the life-altering Elysium Capsule.

The unexpected challenge arises when Ethan and Nikko plan their experiment, which requires breaking into Mira’s lab to access archived ancient datasets of REM sleep patterns and psychological journals. This moment turns into an ethical expedition as they cope with the moral complexities of potentially putting the project’s funding at risk, following Mira’s work and prestige. Through on-the-fly tinkering, they briefly access a more natural sleep via a flawed prototype they self-assemble, awakening to kaleidoscopic dreams of old and pure imaginative wonder. Their deep feelings for innocent creativity collide with feelings of psychological anguish during their adventure—offering paths of resolve for both wellness and art.

The climax erupts as Mira unintentionally discovers their undertaking as they emerge minute later, completely transformed but emotionally flustered and exhausted. Enhanced with evidence that the breakthrough was more than tech supported mental states, she feels conflicted—torn between asserting her maternal authority and recognizing her son’s earnest yearning for authentic experiences. Tempers flare as feelings are expressed, and Ethan challenges the life chosen by his mother and the reliability of escapism in dreams spurred by technology. Ultimately, the realities of their lives expose a violent dichotomy between survival and struggle; Ava experiences consequences that knock her beyond the realm of control, leading residents to extremes where human connection is eroded.

When it all settles, the repercussions of their choices starkly reveal the social ramifications of dependency on manufactured realities. For the first time in ages, as families grapple with communal responsibility for the technological highs and lows of dream experiences, they rally in search of balance: to build a supportive system around natural rest and creativity handcrafted. Together, Ethan, Mira, Ava, and Nikko begin rebuilding their lives—with evenings spent rediscovering bedtime practices centered on unhindered family interactions, exhausted laughter, and uninhibited storytelling, transforming “Bedtime” back into an essential ritual of rest to reclaim genuine dreams. Ultimately, everyone agrees: pure rest—for now—has become both a rebellion against chaos and a path toward authenticity in both sleep and waking worlds.
