In the year 2045, bedtime has become a complex ritual dictated by technology and social norms. Sleep has transformed into an immersive experience known as "Dream Authentication," where individuals engage in a programmed sleep state orchestrated by the QCorps, an influential health conglomerate that specializes in neurological enhancements. Adolescents attend Docu-rooms, where sleep data is fed into VR environments tailored to alleviate stress and ensure their bodies receive optimal rest. The main characters — Alia, an introspective programmer; Roan, her socially-challenged brother; Evie, an adventurous neighbor; and Saxon, the fiery opposition leader of the sleep liberation movement — each navigate their relationship with this new bedtime reality. Alia grapples with her responsibilities at QCorps while hiding her doubts about the benefits of Dream Authentication, Roan prefers to avoid sleep altogether, convinced that he doesn’t need it at all. Evie begs her parents to let her experience a real childhood bedtime without the suffocating protocols of artificial sleep, and Saxon fights fiercely against the system that suddenly dictates even their most private moments.

As the group’s school project on sleep culture breaks into heated discussions, intrigue grows within them over rumors of a forbidden technology called “Pure Dreaming”—a process that allows individuals to bypass the implants that monitor and control their sleep, enabling unregulated dreaming experiences. Fueled by curiosity and covert aspirations, Alia, Roan, and Evie conspire to find this secretive technology. Their quest leads them to hidden Codex archives buried deep within the Bowart District, held by a famed hacker who claims to know how to access Pure Dreaming. All the while, Saxon attempts to rally disenchanted youths to join his movement against QCorps, seeking freedom in uninterrupted sleep, hoping Pure Dreaming might become the beacon of the revolution.

As they penetrate deeper into the heart of this black market, danger looms. They experience unexpected hurdles when they come face-to-face with the powerful agents of QCorps, who are on high alert due to rising opposition sentiment. Torn between loyalty to their family’s desiring comfort and the clamoring belief in pure freedom, Roan tests his physical limits and confronts his deepest fears while Evie taps into the bold spirit that makes her the fearless leader of their rebellion. Alia finds all her coding skills imperative in disabling security grids, but the closer they get to acquiring the technology, the more they realize it elicits the true artwork of dreams – and dread while rendering the experience profoundly alien. The tension erupts as Saxon is captured during an inspection, potentially exposing their mission and forcing all involved to confront what they’re willing to sacrifice for personal freedom.

With a revelation that shockwaves through the community, Alia uncovers that the first protagonist, her brother Roan, actually leads the activism attempts post-human treatment. Emboldened by these new truths, they choose to rescue Saxon and challenge the sins of complacency. The group dynamically teams up to confirm their valor and upheaval against liquid-shadow guards while questioning their relationships and what slumber means to their clockwork existence. Together, they form a tactical plan that takes them through the futuristic labyrinth of advanced tech within their town, forcing them to outsmart both machine and corporation alike if they intend to rescue Saxon and finally taste true liberation from sleep.

Soon afterwards, back in their district, Alia, Roan, and Evie pack away their fear; Saxon reflects on the fervor of dreams and kisses goodbye the arbitrary designations of altered “rest.” While others blindly reconnect to welfare neck-bands that guarantee Dream Authentication encapsulating forced familiarity, they slip away intermittently to experience Pure Dreaming and celebrate their victories. QCorps attempts to rustle the past in error, but their awakening heralds a growing desire within society for a proclaimed agency in choice. In a revelation put forth before parliaments, they share their harrowing journey, making manifest their newfound mission – reframing bedtime not merely as confinement but reclaiming it as a unique tapestry-marker reflective of the surrealism experiences where authenticity means not just shedding restraints but emerging with newly forged relationships, redefining a hopeful reality anew.
