In a world where daylight has become a rare commodity, society has adapted to the prolonged twilight brought about by a relentless climate crisis. Children are now plugged into Virtual Dream Domains (VDDs) at bedtime—a hyper-realistic, AI-driven simulation that trains their minds while they sleep, preparing them for adulthood in an increasingly complex world. In the small sky city of Lumen Crest, where the sun barely peeks through swirling clouds, Lyra, a focused teen eager to ace her AI studies, struggles to decide her future diligently, often requesting more time in her VDD. Her younger brother, Max, is more carefree, exploring fantastical dream landscapes and choosing whimsy over productivity even as their mother, Iris, a socialite fixated on virtual leisure, often encourages them to maximize their sleep with VDD technology. Alistair, their father, a philosopher, remains skeptical of the virtual worlds, believing that true knowledge must originate from real-life experiences, including unstructured sleep.

As pressure mounts for Lyra to excel amid her peers, she also feels an unsettling void that VDDs cannot fill. Lyra questions their absorbed realities when Max reveals he’s experiencing suspicious glitches within his dreams. Official notifications about unexpected “Dream Disturbances” cause concern in their climb to the top of Lumen Crest society. In a desperate search for truth, the siblings explore a hidden subpage deep within the realms of the VDDs—an ancient database of creativity dreams known as the LORME. Choosing to leverage LORME’s immense power, including facets of emotional intelligence and creativity abandoned in rushed simulations, they uncover a striking link to the increasingly strict bedtime rituals endorsed by the city government, implemented at the behest of ambitious educators. Alistair, echoing this unease, rescinds bedtime privileges for the evenings when the outside world weather allows, nurturing natural sleep outside of artificial technologies. 

Increasingly aware of the modulation their realities provide, the tension with their parents arises when they disagree over the utilization of VDDs as a learning tool versus Alistair’s advocate messages championing corporeal exploration of life. During a climactic scene, a total blackout momentary ignites chaos. Citizens panic as VDDs shut down at an unprecedented hourly rate, denying users respite and shocking practice lessons from virtual maturing—Lyra, seeking safety, runs for it. Frustratedly breaking free from traditional child-nurturing boundaries to find Max amidst turbulent strapped sleep—the physical realm and shifting specters indiscriminately deploying echoes of dreams. 

Emerging from the complete disarray, the siblings soon combine strengths to engage free-thinking workshops devised through dreams. Knowing more venturing to gather communal voices hoping to reconnect reach common ground, discovering it's different beyond restrictive systems—the handbook of children's engagement reminds lost pleasures under natural skies. Using enthusiasm sparked in people who come together, Iris transforms too, embracing this extraversion unrepresentative of her typically robotic lifestyle. Their quest leads Lumen Crest toward allowing parents and kids to chart respectable uptime and incorporate true creativity alongside measured rest within community stargazing, unlike the previous night of mechanical guides harnessed false sleepy battle.
