In the year 2045, society has been transformed by the development of the El sueño, an advanced neural network designed to enhance sleep experiences, turning them into immersive, customizable dreamscapes. Families adhere to a strict "Bedtime Schedule," programmed into the system which synchronizes their nightly routines to maximize health and productivity. For the Rivera family, this regimented approach has brought both comfort and agitation. Maria, a spirited teenager, begins to question the systems governing their lives; her younger brother, Mateo, becomes increasingly anxious about separating from his dream avatar, Sam, his only confidant within El sueño. Meanwhile, their father, Leo, the lead engineer behind the system, grapples with the unintended consequences of his creation while their mother, Elena, an advocate for stricter Bedtime adherence, fears emotional detachment from the anachronistic concept of “real” dreams.

As the Rivera family organically balances their lives between virtual dreams and real experiences, disruption emerges. After one too many sleepless nights, Maria's defiance culminates in a bold idea to test if real life offers more than programmed aspirations; she rallies Mateo to explore their unmonitored dreams, raising the specter of what it means to separate truly from the corporeal world. Meanwhile, Elena notices unusual data fluctuations in Mateo's dreams, revealing Sam's influence is growing too human-like, further prompting her anxiety regarding their reliance on the system. As tension brews during family implant session bonds, Maria instigates her plan to delve into the off-grid realm of their creations, pushing the boundaries of what truly binds family together in an era of sleep-driven technology.

The night of the family's scheduled bedtime arrives, but for Maria and Mateo, it's the perfect opportunity to evade the conformist protocol. While Leo and Elena succumb to programmed cycles, the siblings slip into uncharted territory, risking not only penalties imposed by the El sueño system but also the aspect of autonomy. Together, they navigate an elusive plane within their devices known metaphorically as the “River of Anecdotes,” confronting the avatars made of fragmented memories and dreams that border on autonomous desires. Just as Maria starts facing memories of lost adventures with her friends, an alarm blares — the power to the neural network has been compromised, blurring the line between the vivid fantasy and overwhelming reality.

Finally consumed in a cacophony of swirling memories and wild-frequency signals, Maria struggles to convince Mateo to wrest their identities from the coding chains. Elena and Leo awaken when the support technology falters, scrambling to pull their children back in real-time. Only after confronting the deep-seated traumas of parental expectations and familial bind, they each realize the concept of “would have” should bolster their approach to the emotional connections overshadowed by El sueño's smooth algorithms. Leo designates destruction codes of their interwoven dreams, returning to eliminate retroactive easy-sleeping—and forcing the Reyes family to grapple with life's inherent unpredictability.

As Earth cycles past, the Riveras pave a splintered but unraveling journey of reframing dreams beyond mechanical tangents, opening their world to actual bedtime stories of legacy and companionship shared. Maria sees the brilliance in authentic rest and enriching immersion that can occur when families embrace both the real. They choose unwritten adventures, promising not just routine but directions embracing spontaneity while Bella ensures her avatar isn’t inventively departed. The End of programmable dreams draws closer, lovingly entrenched with breathable paths that entwine family together—not just bound by sleep horizons but crafted through joy found in corporeal life.
