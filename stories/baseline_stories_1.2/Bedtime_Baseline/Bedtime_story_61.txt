In the year 2045, society has transformed the concept of "Bedtime" into a nightly collective experience, facilitated by the BedSync System, a neural network that synchronizes sleep cycles for optimal well-being and productivity. People gather in high-rise SleepPods—converted urban apartments—equipped with advanced VR technology allowing users to enter vivid dreamscapes together. Amelia, a once-prominent sleep technologist, now grapples with regrets over her role in creating this dystopian utopia. Her longstanding friend Korin works as an Ethics Monitor for BedSync and routinely clashes with Amelia over the implications of their work. They are joined by Jax, an overnight sleep researcher intrigued by the behavioral impacts of BedSync and Agnes, an elderly woman whose life simplicity contrasts starkly with the complexities around her.

One evening, after a restless day alone, Amelia uncovers a loophole within the BedSync software leading to unregulated dream access—essentially a digital black market where people pay to dream an alternate life or escapade without societal scrutiny. Disheartened by the loss of personal dreaming, Amelia decides to partake, teaming up with Korin, who reluctantly joins as a means to investigate. Meanwhile, Jax rolls out an experimental program to combat users’ dependency on the technology, while Agnes inadvertently becomes their wild card. She leads an underground movement of “De-synchers,” a group that advocates for natural sleep, gathering knowledge from decades before BedSync took control over their nocturnal realities.

As they delve deeper—experiencing decadent fantasies that blur the lines between reality and imagination—the group unravels the truths surrounding individual identity amidst a manufactured utopia. However, tensions mount when Jax discovers that a powerful corporate player is pulling strings behind the scenes, morphing BedSync into a form of societal control to harvest personal data during dream sequences. The team realizes that their own aspirations about freedom and genuine human connection are slipping away. On a daring quest to expose this profit-driven agenda, they confront the corporate leadership during a tucked-away "sleep" gala where corporate elites convene to market new advancements, forcing conflict to surface over the ethical grounds for social cohesion.

During the climax, their infiltrative attempts turn chaotic as the trio feels the cumulative pressure of lying plain features, merging distortions between reality and dream. In a defining moment, Amelia confronts her deepest fears—a regret for catalyzing BedSync’s reign—by harnessing unconventional technology that would revert Synthesizers to their natural rhythms. As pandemonium reigns in the SleepPod arena and lives are reconsidered, Agnes rallies friendships and wisdom among attendees, calling for an embrace of difference rather than suppression. Meanwhile, Jax leverages his research findings to destabilize BedSync’s gravitational hold over the people, creating a sparkling, revitalized glitch in the BedSync dream sequence.

As dawn breaks on a data-strewn glitter away in the shadows of grand technologies, things begin to reshape into a renaissance of sleep. The world wakes, abruptly, detracting from the orchestrated beginnings of different-headed societies, an exploration of impossibilities ahead. Amelia's conflict resolved in acceptance—the acknowledgment that genuine connection and selffulfillment are gifts that ultimately stem from control and dreams must be invaluable touchstones, elements of being whole. Empowered but humbled, Amelia and Korin use their tech know-how to create footprints towards strength, co-authoring a new reality of simplistic beauty; while Lavish Jax students Ishmael trajectory bends truth justly beyond conventions—embarking only forward—guiding for bedtimes anew. Agnes takes her place among collaborative inspires, shaping something lasting—a gentle end to stifling orchestrations and embracing instead the richness that only personalized human experiences can compel in an interplay vibrant and unattached congregating framed brightly blessed dream assorted life messaging freshly into varied nights ahead.
