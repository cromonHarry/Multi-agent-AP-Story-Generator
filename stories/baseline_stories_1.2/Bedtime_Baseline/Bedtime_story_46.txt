In the near future, the concept of bedtime has undergone a radical transformation. In the sprawling megacity of Vespera, where encapsulated dynamic cities have risen above the dust-choked ground, societal norms have shifted to favor a world never at rest. Here, time is a currency often hoarded instead of shared, leading to a culture where people engage in ‘Powernapping’ – a newly minted practice encouraged by tech companies that exploit chronic fatigue and anxiety to market sleep-inducing gadgets. Halan, a determined sleep technician, works for Resotime Corp, known for its neural-modulator devices designed to streamline sleep cycles within short bursts. Her brother Dax, a meditation pod developer, grapples with the ethical implications of their money-driven innovations. They navigate the whims of their ambitious friend Nyla, a charismatic social media influencer who has come to embody the ‘Always Awake’ lifestyle. Last but not least, is Glyde, an undercover advocate for these ‘terrible slumbers,’ working under a platform that promotes natural resting habits.

Complications arise when Halan reluctantly accepts an assignment to prototype an upgraded version of the neural-modulator, now capable of inducing Microdreams—instant virtual realities accessed through sleep. Halan feels an unsettled twinge as she observes the repercussions of calculating mind-juggling, seeing clients emerge more drained than before, struggling to reconcile the elusive micro-experiences they've endured. Contrarily, Dax physically defiantly rejects the technology’s ideology and continuously tries to convince his sister that balance through genuine rest, love for sleep, is a path worth pursuing amid a world driven by profit and illusion. Nyla, intoxicated by the wave she created on social media, argues for the foreseeable irrelevance of traditional sleep, gaining massive popularity as her followers chase her every dangerous escapade.

The phenomenal nature of the prototype reaches a climax when a viral challenge is launched by Nyla to showcase the best Microdreams from Resotime’s trending advertisements. Dax, fearing for his sister’s mental state and the adverse impact of such frivolity, attempts to intervene, taking to platforms to plead for responsibility and warning unsuspecting users of the painful aftereffects of artificially manufactured sleep. Tensions swirl as Halan finds herself torn between corporate desires fueling economic gain and her steadily gathering anxiety for mental health and genuine rest associated with her family, confronting both the addiction towards sleep-tech and Nyla's uniquely perilous trajectory.

Yet, the situation spirals out of control during a live-streamed event, where Dax publicly showcases a darkly-layered shred of evidence detailing psychological addiction cases stemming from the Neural Protocol gone wrong. Halan watches in horrified silence as the chaotic digital mix of reality and dreams disorients Nyla's vast fanbase. By offhand comments, speaking directly to human struggles for meaning and empowerment, Dax calls for an urgent rethink of values defining society’s bedtime routines. Wathing and mashing against the data, Halan remembers the quiet moments they shared at their childhood home—a time marked by naïveté and warmth—and ultimately feels the urge to break the chain of expectancy choking Web After Dark entities.

As turmoil calms and advocates for mindfulness such as Dax begin reshaping societal discourse, Halan takes what’s left of her work under Resotime and pivots it towards family restoratives. Reinventing the potential of sleep to serve rather than entrap, she hopes to incorporate her family’s joint philosophies into peaceful escapism workshops centered on destroying tech-snared sleeping patterns. Realigning herself with natural rhythms, Halan emerges, brandishing ‘Z 伯래(“Heavenly Slumber”)’—a redefined pledge devoid of time constraints, aiming to resurrect the sacred and restorative essence of bedtime. Resiliently connected with both her brother and newly-vigilant Nyla, they envision transforming bedtime infinitely— a tender lanes away from isolation and to eternal family tethering.
