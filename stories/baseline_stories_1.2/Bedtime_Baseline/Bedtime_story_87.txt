In the year 2045, society has transformed dramatically. In this new world, SleepConverge, a groundbreaking technology, allows individuals to share dreams and experiences through a neural-link system. Every evening, families around the globe connect through lenses that enable a collective bedtime experience, blurring the lines between dreams and reality. The Johnsons—a family of four comprising mother Ava, father Martin, their two teenage kids, Jake and Lila—have become deeply entrenched in this nightly ritual. The promise of Abenteuerlink, a new bedtime feature where dreams can be curated and enhanced, has captivated their imaginations. However, unbeknownst to them, this tight bond has begun to foster secrets that could threaten the harmony within their family unit.

As the introduction date for Abenteuerlink approaches, the Johnsons prepare for the unveiling with excitement. Ava envisions amplifying their family's cherished memories, Lila hopes to connect more deeply with her friends in the virtual realm, and Jake has grown fascinated with extreme dream experiences, desiring thrill rather than sentiment. However, Martin feels uneasy about the changes this technology will bring to their family dynamics. As he reflects on sleepless nights spent plugged into virtually shared dreams, he starts noticing how disconnected they have become as individuals, their own personalities melding with their digital avatars’ fantasies. When he discovers that Jake plans to create an exhilarating dream linked to a plan to run away from home, Martin feels compelled to intervene.

One evening, right before their scheduled AdventureLink experience, a heated argument erupts between them. Jake and Lila insist that their mother engagingly narrate one impossible journey after another would make their experience complete, while Martin insists that dreams should be personal. Tensions escalate, and the ensuing fracture leaves Martin isolated, feeling betrayed by the machine that was meant to strengthen their family bond. As they settle into their SleepConverge pods, the energy in the house shifts, laden with unspoken words and unresolved feelings. With the tension palpable, the family drifts into an unsettling realm where their shared digital dreams take on a twisted form that forces them to confront hidden resentments and truths.

In the middle of their collective dream, each family member is plagued by liminal manifestations of their fears and unspoken grievances, represented in various dreamscapes that echo their emotional distance. Jake’s desire for adventure leads the group to a dangerous landscape, while Lila’s longing to remain connected cancels stability altogether. Only through these surreal experiences does it become clear: they are trapped in their desired world of wonder, highlighting the darker corners of their escaping individual selves. At that moment, Martin realizes they must awaken and confront the chaos, emphasizing the necessity of detaching from the allure of technology and reconnecting by sharing authentic feelings instead of relying purely on artificial experiences.

As dawn breaks, the disturbed Johnsons awaken from their shared journey, disoriented yet stirred into new awareness. The remnants of their chaotic dream shatter the pretense that their connections were solely based on curatable bedtime experiences. Confronting each other around their breakfast table, they begin sharing the truths of their individual dreams, revealing aspirations, fears, and stories far removed from any orchestrated simulation. Ultimately, they agree to take collective steps to reclaim their bedtime routines—trading ScreenConverge lenses for goodnight stories told around an actual campfire in the backyard. The Johnsons realize that satiating their need for connection lies not in artificial realms, but within real life, laughing and baring their vulnerabilities without the dim glow of devices illuminating their hearts.
