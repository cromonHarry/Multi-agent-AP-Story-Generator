In a not-so-distant future, the concept of Bedtime has transformed drastically with the advent of advanced neurotech and AI-assisted environments. In the sprawling metropolis of New Dynamo, citizens plug into personalized "Slumber Suites” — bioengineered rooms that optimize sleep through tailored environments and dreamscapes programmed to reflect personal desires. Among the denizens of New Dynamo is Lira, an overworked physician haunted by tragic dreams. Her brother Ray, a brilliant yet disillusioned coder, ignores his rest to design the latest Slumber Suite software. A perceptive journalist named Samiya, curious about rapid societal changes, attempts to uncover the downside of over-reliance on these immersive sleep experiences. Meanwhile, Miguel, a lobbyist for “Bedtime Freedom,” believes that humanity is losing its essence as they abandon traditional practices in favor of synthetic slumber.

As tensions in society rise surrounding the implications of sleep technology, Samiya's detective work reveals alarming reports of individuals "lost in sleep" — mindlessly trapped in seductive dream layouts. During a personal investigation into this phenomenon, she encounters Lira, who shares her frustrations stemming from a recent disturbing episode where she witnessed her mother mourning in her sleep — a nuisance born from sleep tech while evading emotional confrontation. Meanwhile, Ray becomes increasingly tormented by a creeping realization that his creations may be endangering lives instead of improving them. As the trio––Lira, Samiya, and Ray––join forces, they also cross paths with Miguel, who seeks their help to expose the loopholes and flaws within the industry that promote addiction over health.

Fueled by determination, the group devises a plan to infiltrate a corporate facility that micro-manages the city’s Slumber Suite programming. They each hold key insider knowledge: Ray through his coding expertise, Lira leveraging her medical background, Samiya planning for media exposé, and Miguel rallying support from a burgeoning underground community afraid of losing their humanity to fabricated experiences. As they navigate through the corporation’s heavy security and discover a hidden chamber filled with testimonials of people held in virtual limbo, they uncover evidence of intentional exploitation masked as ‘therapeutic proximity.’

In a climactic confrontation, they are caught by drones securing corporate secrets. Lira, faced with a flicker of her dreams threatening to trap her, rallies the group with the realization that they must combat these innovations not just through exposing truths but re-embracing the raw essence of relationship-driven sleep practices. They manage to hack into the Slumber Suites feed and broadcast their findings for all users, sparking public outrage, elevating procedural lawsuits, and reigniting debate about authenticity and human navigate sleep itself.

In the aftermath, the culture of Bedtime shifts, as individuals begin to demand experiences that foster real, meaningful connections before sleep rather than insular, solitary sessions. The four protagonists find renewed purpose—Lira, now leading a community initiative encouraging open dialogues on mental health; Ray, focused on blending coding talents with therapeutic values gained from human interaction; Samiya, immersively documenting the cultural resurrection of Bedtime through her analytics; and Miguel, emerging as a pioneer of authentic restful rituals. In reclaiming their sleep, society starts unearthing its long-lost vigor, truly grasping the beauty in the ritual before slumber, one dream crafted at a time.
