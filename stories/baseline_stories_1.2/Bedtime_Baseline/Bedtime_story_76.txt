In the year 2045, the concept of bedtime has transformed dramatically due to advancements in technology and psychological research. In the sky towers of New York, families inhabit smart homes filled with devices designed to optimize rest. Seven-year-old Mia Harlow often struggles to early sleep as her parents, Celia and Felix, run a startup producing advanced sleep pods that invoke dream states tailored to individual desires. Also living with them is Agustin, Celia's elder brother, a self-proclaimed dream engineer whose dystopian novel about lives lost to endless sleep casts a shadow over their tinkerings. As the Harlow family prepares for another sleep-cycle, tensions from Mia's rebellious bedtime habits bubble to the surface.

As they settle in for the evening, Mia becomes resistant to her patented Sleep Halo, a device her parents created that envelopes users in customized audio-visual experiences. Instead, she dreams of wandering the vibrant evenings of Old New York, dotted with the laughter of children unchained by smart technology. Agustin warns her about the dangers of overindulgence in idyllic dreams and prophecies from his novel start to weigh on his mind — a world where citizens were grafted onto pods, losing touch with reality. Tension rises as Mia takes matters into her own hands; refusing the Halo, she sneaks off to the base of their tower in the efforts to connect with the bustling nights she imagines, unaware that her pod needs a substantial power charge.

In a fit of frustration, Felix decrees that Mia must start obeying bedtime regulations or risk having her malfunctioning serious imagination dreams repaired, a tactic rooted in technological fears. Harnessing newfound courage, Mia confronts her parents about their obsession with robotic slumber and the quiet loss of her individuality. Her declaration reverberates through her family, causing them to question the efficacy of their age-old chase for a perfect night's sleep. Agustin, sensing the familial fracture, decides to advocate for a middle-ground solution where each member explores their authentic desires in slumber versus being submerged in tailored escapes. Perhaps the answer lies in balance, within discovering as much about themselves as their gadgets could offer—a bittersweet song of invention and autonomy.

Emotions reach an apex as this philosophical battle begins to shatter the conventional fabric of family beliefs. During a tempest, the power grid falters, cutting energy to the apartment and knocking out all smart gadgets, including the Sleep Halo. For the first time in months, the Harlow family transitions to manual options—stories shared on their porch, collective prayers at candlelight—redefining ‘bedtime’ as a cherished human ritual rather than a conditional endpoint. In this twilight, Mia curates an impromptu bedtime tale filled with their wishes and dreams, although unchained from static programs. They laugh and reminisce, enjoying infinite possibilities as a familiar sense of warmth vows to linger long after the glow of devices is extinguished.

In the days that follow, Mia emerges with a thriving curiosity as she reinvigorates her parents’ creativity, challenging them to secure future moments. Celia and Felix decide to pivot their vocation toward fostering communal sleep spaces where magic awaits without the individual desire dampened or extinguished. They unveil ‘Time Break’ locales—private new Pop-Up relaxation areas where sleepers mutually exchange silky tales of adventure, guiding titles culminating toward dreams worthy of detection. The symbolism of bedtime replenishes their own worth by uniting; energizing a new social framework for sheltering possibilities. By melding modernity and simplicity, the family finds solace that perhaps radical evolution sometimes thrives not purely inside dreams, but within the twilight of uncharted connection transforming routine into passion.
