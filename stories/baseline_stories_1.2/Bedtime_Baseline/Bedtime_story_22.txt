In the near future, society has acclimated to a world dominated by technology, shifting bedtime into a complex ritual dictated by personalized algorithms. The government provides citizens with Neural Sleep Masks imbued with advanced AI, which analyze each individual’s life patterns and emotional states through biometric data to optimize sleep quality. Our protagonist, Farah, a bustling urban planner in the megacity of New Axis, finds herself struggling to balance her professional demands and personal life. Living with her two teenage children, Leo and Mira, and her tech-savvy brother, Zane, they often clash over their differing views of technology's role in daily life, especially bedtime. While Farah longs for a more natural rhythm, Mira champions the gadgets that promise a path to instantaneous tranquility, and Leo continually pushes for more freedom from regimented schedules.

Conflict arises when Farah discovers a hidden algorithm in the Neural Sleep Mask's software that reprograms bedtime routines, favoring productivity over personal well-being. She argues with Mira over the impacts of the technology, worried that it disconnects them from their humanity and erodes family connections. Zane attempts to mediate the disagreements but secretly disapproves of the masks’ design, whispering ideas of potential for malfunction or upgrade leaks. Tensions escalate when Leo gets a mandatory internship during hours that drastically disrupt his sleep patterns. Coping with bad rest and altered moods, Leo becomes temperamental and withdrawn, igniting parental concern and coexistence friction within their technologically influenced household.

In a desperate attempt to reclaim control, Farah decides to investigate the company that produces the Neural Sleep Mask, determined to expose the hampered integrity of the so-called "smart" technology. She plunges into an underground forum of hijackers and rebel sleep activists where she reluctantly teams up with a maverick hacker, Elara, who has learned to override gadgets to redefine personal sleep preferences autonomously. Their alliance allows Farah to navigate the company’s secure databases, uncovering unethical practices fueling mass addiction to performance-enhancing sleep tech. As Elara executes a bold plan to hack the algorithm to reset citizens' nightly scripts back to a more humane version, Farah faces a precarious choice. 

The climax of their struggle materializes as the hacking operation instigates an alarm throughout the company’s headquarters; they only have minutes to implement their changes before detection. Mira, torn between loyalty to her mother and fascination with her tech lifestyle, ultimately decides to harness her knowledge of the masks to aid in the escape. Together with Zane covering their backs, Farah watches as integrity is restored not only to her family but symbolically to others in society as well. The masks jerk uncontrollably; without their tightening grip on everyone's routines, people rediscover the importance of downtime and hint again at what it’s like to engage with one another without mediation from a screen.

In the resolution, a newfound presence hangs throughout New Axis as citizens slowly relearn the art of bedtime. Families across the city revive traditions centered around restful evenings, emphasizing storytelling and sharing among loved ones instead of isolating tech-driven rituals. Farah, no longer constrained by an alarm-driven existence, uses her skills as an urban planner to design communal night markets, transforming urban environments filled with sleep-centered workshops. Going forward, she vows to tolerate a slower-paced evening lifestyle while embracing imperfections over mere productivity. With their Neural Masks rendered powerless, Farah, Mira, Zane, and Leo come together more than ever, opening newfound avenues for connection in warmth and purpose as twilight dims.
