In the year 2145, the world has transformed into a vibrant, tech-driven oasis, where neuro-reality interfaces govern daily life. The divide between sleep and wakefulness has blurred, and with it, the concept of “bedtime” has radically evolved; it now refers to a programmed retreat into carefully curated dream experiences that offer both escapism and psychological therapy. Maya, a proactive dream therapist still influenced by the traditional understanding of rest, works to reintroduce the lost art of honest, unaccompanied sleep. Her longtime friend and colleague, Remy, a programmer of dream simulations, sees Maya's longing for the past as bizarre but interesting, believing that their innovations have truly perfected the sleeping experience. They are joined by Alex, a child prodigy showing remarkable talent in dream control, and Kat, Maya's teenage daughter grappling with the distinction between truth and simulation in her own existence.

As bedtime processes become overseen by personalized dream diaries that collect not just preferences but emotional responses, clients seek experiences ranging from thrilling adventures to serene return trips to childhood memories. However, beneath the gleaming surface lies a rising epidemic dubbed "The Disconnect." More and more users, entranced by exhaustive artificial reveries, begin to ignore their real lives, losing the ability to connect with experiences. Night after night, sleeplessness is conflated with the search for deeper satisfaction. Hearing frantic rumors of clients succumbing to the Disconnect—some never to emerge from their dreams—Maya proposes a radical idea: an analogue sleep retreat, a temporary haven offering the raw human experience devoid of sedatives, interfaces, and mechanisms that have become common even to the unsophisticated sleeper-index.

Together, they orchestrate the retreat under starlit skies, isolating themselves in a re-purposed cabin within a retreat that harkens back to pre-digital lifestyles, emphasizing simplicity, honesty, and uncurated sleep. Maya hopes to reintegrate the fading sensations of genuine rest, while Kat struggles with controlling her own induced tables of subliminal thoughts that bubble forth during sleep. Alex is drawn like a moth to a flame, intrigued by the emotional depth of this project, often dealing with taunting shadows of his own subconscious that he cannot trap—a result of an upbringing dominated by nerdy enhancements. In these claustrophobic quarters, tensions heighten–when a series of catastrophic nightmares infect their dreams, threatening the safety of their minds and dragging them back into digital illusions.

As dreamed realities meld with the conscious realm, the four must confront their fears that slip through the boundaries of their intended experiences. Kat discovers secrets within her visions about self-identity and internal expectation, ultimately realizing she has been seeking autocratic worth in manufactured dreams prompted by others’ desires. Remy’s confidence unravels with the death of a fictional collective where he lost creative authority. Realizing the Disconnect serves every being differently, heralded by the transformative traumatic fallout inflicted in dreams, they resolve to harness techniques to shatter the meticulous dream-keeping machinery gnawing on their existence.

In the aftermath, their friendship rekindles as a means to neither explore digital fictions nor shun them entirely. Maya collaborates with Remy to create levels of interface moderation designed to enable pre-dream journaling processes entwined with emotional literacy teachings. They breed a world where the essence of “bedtime” regains its magic through the exploration of raw emotions and vivid imagination, distinguishing authentic consciousness from alluring configurations. Meanwhile, Kat and Alex nurture a reciprocal understanding of the power of dreams—aware that metaphysical sleep, just as reality, reveals great challenges but equally tempting truths, propelling them forward into vibrant new tomorrows, grounded entirely in their newfound unity.
