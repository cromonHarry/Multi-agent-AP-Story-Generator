In the year 2045, society has drastically transformed the concept of "Bedtime," where sleep is no longer a daily necessity thanks to a patch that can fully recharge the human body and mind in mere hours. For the majority, this revolutionary invention has allowed for lives filled with productivity and ceaseless entertainment. Ava, a vibrant but anxious young woman who struggles with insomnia, constantly finds herself daunted by a society that values this technological advancement over natural rest. Her best friend, Leo, awakens energized and filled with potential after using the sleep patch nightly, often encouraging her to try it as well. In contrast, Taryn, a bioethicist advocating for the preservation of natural human rhythms, fights to raise awareness about the long-term effects of comprehensive sleep replacement technology leading to cultural dissonance and psychological disruption.

One evening, after another tense day spent tossing and turning in her room, Ava attends a social gathering that Leo organized to showcase the latest in bedtime tech. Here, she meets Cole, a rebellious former tech developer who believes humanity is losing its connection to the real power of dreams. Regardless of his disdain for mainstream practices, he feels captivated by Ava’s struggles and vulnerabilities. Fishbowl conversations bloom as the characters exchange views. Cole becomes Ava's confidant and ally, at once awakening her buried appreciation for the traditional nocturnal routine but also introducing her to the unsettling realities of a society dominated by artificial sleep solutions. Tentatively, Ava decides to explore both helping Taryn’s cause and navigating her own relationship with Leo.

As Ava grapples with the mounting pressures to conform and adopt the sleep patch, she consults Taryn for advise: "What if I'm alone, never catching up to everyone's ideal?" Amidst clouds of confusion, Taryn reveals there are factions forming against the fabrications of artificial awareness, rallying support for natural sleep. Inspired yet conflicted, Ava decides while her friends cling to convenience, deeper parts of her fear losing her identity to synthetic comfort. Tensions begin to escalate as gangs of advocates grow increasingly hostile toward tech proponents, leading to violent confrontations that further ingrain societal divides.

In a twist of fate, Ava finds herself injected into the midst of conflict. On a radical night, she accompanies Cole to one of Taryn's burgeoning resistance meetings, only to make a shocking discovery—Leo is the key speaker promoting the indentured twists of sleep adaptation technology. While entangled in unsure whispers and half-forgotten dreams, Ava faces her disturbing truth about friends warping into whitewashed versions of their former selves. That same night, amid sirens and panic, Taryn is arrested while trying to rally public protest. Ava’s adrenaline surges, bolstered by unpredictable starlight and revelations—the cogs turn to an awakening reconciled with both revelation and affliction.

Though the tumult eventually settles, the liberated crowd embraces alternative sleep routines framed through visions ignited by Ava growing deeper into her understanding of freedom. She envisions a public where sleep remains a personal, holistic experience, no longer distorted by corporate agendas masquerading as virtue. Leo revisits his past reverently, realizing friendships transcend mere technologies. Cole, ultimately disillusioned yet triumphant through sound heartbeats under dreamy lands, leaves the community to develop tech focused on experimentation rather than automation. Taryn returns with a reinvigorated resolve to help push society toward celebrating Traditional Night as a national chance at ritual. In the end, awakened by community myths and motivation, life clockwork rearranges focus—everyone no longer thirsts only for responsive mornings but demands the beauty expressed after cherished Night.
