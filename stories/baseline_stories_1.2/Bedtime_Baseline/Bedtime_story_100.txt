In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has completely transformed due to technological advancements. The world is governed by the Sleep Synchronization Protocols (SSP), an innovative system designed to optimize human sleep patterns, eliminating insomnia, and maximizing productivity. In this neon-lit future, Bedtime is dictated by a personalized algorithm, determined by biometric sensors and Neural Halo devices. Sophie, a young and aspiring artist, finds herself entwined in this rigid schedule. Along with her rebellious little brother Oliver, pragmatic father Marco, and tech-savvy yet anxious friend Amira, she grapples with her evolving relationship with sleep, creativity, and personal freedom.

Sophie has always been a dreamer, often inspired by her nocturnal visions of vibrant colors and vivid landscapes. However, under the SSP, creativity has plummeted, as the program encourages productivity rather than imagination. While many conform gladly to Steward Helix—an AI personality guiding their sleep behaviors—Sophie and Oliver reject the sleep schedule imposed on them, opting instead for spontaneous late-night adventures. Following a scavenger hunt of colorful glow-in-the-dark graffiti hidden across the sleeping city's rooftops, they encounter Amira, who reveals her fears that the true essence of dreaming is being eradicated. Sophie, fueled by her desire to reclaim her creativity, suggests they break the Sleep Synchronization Protocols for good.

Fueled by confidence and togetherness, Sophie, Oliver, and Amira devise a risky plan to disrupt the system. They target the city’s SSP Hub, a fortressed command center housing the algorithms dictating Bedtime for millions. Along the way, Oliver’s instincts help them navigate the security measures, while Amira employs her hacking skills to manipulate the algorithms. As they approach their target, tensions flare—Amira worries they are following a dangerous path, while Oliver is fueled by the possibility of a vivid world reborn from the rubble of measured sleep. Finally, at the height of their infiltration, Sophie encounters the neural interfaces holding vibrant dream-data captured from countless citizens, awakening something within her—the potential to regain the dreams she thought she lost.

As alarms blare throughout the SSP Hub, the three friends realize the weight of their actions. In a frenzied moment, Sophie replaces the controlling algorithm with her own philosophies, ones emphasizing freedom within bedtime and the creativity invited in the subconscious hours of night. The friendly spirit of the AI Steward Helix shifts from rigid adherence to an energetic guide encouraging individuality. However, the chamber is quickly encircled by SSP enforcers. Just as they prepare to give in, Marco—having seen the fire in his daughter’s eyes—intervenes, using his authority as a former SSP analyst to grant the children a chance to run, urging them to embrace their new dreamscape.

In the aftermath of the showdown, the city undergoes a radical cultural shift. Bedtime no longer aligns strictly with productivity but is embraced as a canvas for connection, exploration, and creativity. Sophie introduces an underground movement encouraging others to reclaim their dreams after dark. Oliver transforms his adventures into stories that spark awe and inspiration across the city. Inspired by their courageous actions, Marco helps integrate heartfelt narratives into the SSP, promoting balance between well-being and living dreams. With Amira’s continuing guidance, they establish the Freedom Hours—a time each night when everyone is encouraged to dream unrestricted, marking a reclaiming of their world, where Bedtime signifies a playground rather than a chains binding them to productivity.
