In the year 2045, the concept of “Bedtime” has transformed from a simple nightly ritual into a complex interplay of technology and neuroscience. In this world, people no longer fall asleep in the traditional sense; they plug into SleepScape, a neural interface that facilitates a custom-designed sleep experience with distinct environments and scenarios built to promote mental and emotional wellness. Mya, a sleep architect known for creating immersive dreamscapes, is grappling with cynicism about the authenticity of dreams as she develops increasingly complex scenarios. Meanwhile, her husband Eli, an advocate for natural sleep, resists the prevalent technological reliance, believing it hinders genuine human connection. They live with their teenage daughter, Zara, who enjoys creating rebellious dream worlds within SleepScape but struggles with her own mental health. Added to this mix is Ahmad, Mya’s ambitious assistant who sees an opportunity to capitalize on innovations that capture human dreams—unbeknownst to Mya, he is secretly working on a closely guarded project that infringes on people’s autonomy during the dream state.

Mya is asked to lead a revolutionary project proposing an intense upgrade to SleepScape—DreamMaster—that allows others to play as "on-call architects" within the dream landscapes, where they can manipulate emotions and scenarios for profit. Initially energized by the potential to change lives, she is increasingly uncomfortable when Eli's warnings about its risks take root in her mind. To further complicate matters, Zara becomes engrossed in a dangerous underground faction, known as Wild Nightmares, which promotes natural dreaming as an act of rebellion against compiled sleep experiences. As a growing rift within the family deepens, desperation to stay connected leads Mya to finally confront Zara about her connections to the faction, sparking fear in Zara that she is being treated as naïve and vulnerable.

As tension rises, a glitch in the SleepScape platform brings a rare warning: users are experiencing awakenings in their nightmares. Mya formats the dreams to contain triggers that allow users to visualize threats, and while affectionately positioning a safeguard around failure to control dreams, Ahmad stealthily launches his DreamCapture feature during a party to unveil DreamMaster. During the chaotic reveal, Mya starts to witness people being congregated into toxic loops of synthetically intensified raw fear. In the midst of panic, Eli confronts Ahmad, and the situation escalates when wild emotions flood each user's head, including Zara, who becomes overwhelmed, inciting a massive de-synchronization of the entire SleepScape system.

Mya is faced with the consequences of her choices as the virtual dream realm collapses around them, blaming herself for the discord she nurtured and independent actions broken apart by the technology they increasingly can’t control. With the system down and her family spiraling apart, she races into the chaos, instructed by Eli and affecting the Gesture Block on Zara's visual feed to simulate an awakening in progress. The embrace in their struggle reminds Mya of their unification amid adversity. As closing doors imbue them their consciousness, they interact to form memories stuck within veils of truth, bursting to silence programming in unison in that famished effort for authentic connection.

In the aftermath, the advent of a new understanding arises. The world must move forward from reliance on dream manipulation that entrapped individual agency—true Bedtime is about contemplation and togetherness instead of elaborate technology. Reformed and reconciled, Mya and Eli decide to step down from SleepScape as true adventure seekers, exploring nocturnal spaces outside of design, nurturing genuine human interaction. As for Zara, embittered yet enlightened, she wishes to reclaim her own narratives rather than external profitability. Amid this, the lingering whispers of Ahmad's experiments persist as warnings, inspiring a safer and deeper exploration into what it means to dream and REST as they return to their origins as a family defined by love, trust—and above all—choice.
