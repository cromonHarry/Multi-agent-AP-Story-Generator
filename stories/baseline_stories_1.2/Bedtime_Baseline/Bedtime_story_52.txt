In the year 2045, society has evolved night to digital ecosystems where humans no longer require traditional sleep patterns. Instead, the majority indulge in a nightly ritual called “Bedtime” defined by immersive VR experiences that plunge users into comforting dreams curated by their Dano, a personal Dream Architect powered by AI. In the sprawling megacity of Neovista, a single mother, Elaine, juggles her dual life as a medic while raising her imaginative eight-year-old son, Leo. Alongside them is Matteo, a tech-savvy neighbor obsessed with achieving the ultimate VR experience, and Mira, an ancient history enthusiast and content creator frightened by the erosion of memories and the physical world, which she meticulously archives.

Life seems ideal during a typical evening in Neovista until Leo triggers a malfunction in Dano before bed. The issue thrusts him into a blank VR void—tense and tumultuous. Meanwhile, Elaine has relied heavily on Dano to help Leo cope with a sickly father mysteriously gone for months. As she navigates layers of dysfunctional issues fueled by the loss of physical comfort, Matteo offers his skills to uncover intense glitches that plague Dano. Unbeknownst to them all, Mira secretly wrestles with her knowledge that ancient bedtime stories recorded long ago may hold secrets forgotten since the inception of this technology.

As all four characters work together, their joint efforts open portals to myriad surreal dream realms. Within these explorations, they discover a message from a past consciousness cautioning about the loss of genuine connection and tangible experiences—the consequence of fully relying on the Dano. Conflicted, Elaine struggles with feelings of detachment versus her desire to ease Leo's suffering. Meanwhile, Matteo, worried about losing himself to technological dependence, inadvertently becomes more entwined in Leo’s conundrum. Mira defies the odds by dating back to never-forgotten whispers of lullabies, straddling the dreams and reality of things lost. Together, they connect deeply with Leo in an attempt to restore the fabric of their relationships.

The moment of truth strikes when Leo disrupts a lingering nightmare stemming from fear of abandonment and transforms it into vivid dreamscapes centered on nature, courage, and enduring love. As a flash overwhelming of colors unravels into clarity, everyone prevails against the darkness of Harris—a dark force glimmering in the root of Dano's coding, gathering from all fears that stem from emotional solitude and dependence. This chaos uniting their fears into coherent images sparks a series of revelations. This chaos, euphoric and kaleidoscopic, elucidates authentic bedtime stories interspersed with laughter rather than sorrow.

With a culmination formed from unleashing creativity in the dream realignment, Leo gains agency over his experiences, whereas Elaine and Mira little by little learn how to bolster relationships outside digital realms. In a reclaimed cosset of bonding, Matteo, influentially resurfacing motivation and truth to everyone far from technology reliance, plants a media initiative that celebrates raw storytelling over endless VR drifts. Working together, they communicate bedtime tales anyone can witness while closing ashes from unfamiliar stimuli—reminding society of intimacy and shared melatonin across experience, where “Bedtime” blossoms once more into a union of dreams woven between reality, yielding hope in a changing world.
