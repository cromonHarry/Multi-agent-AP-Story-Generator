In the year 2045, grocery shopping has transformed into an automated experience where personal holographic assistants, known as Grocy, guide consumers through virtual store aisles. Each citizen has a unique grocery profile based on their dietary preferences, spending habits, and ethical choices. In the mid-rise sprawl of New Chicago, four friends—Anika, a forward-thinking nutritionist; Marcos, an eco-conscious programmer; Jade, a skeptic of technology reliant on personal health apps; and Lyle, a charismatic entrepreneur ready to capitalize on food tech—each rely on their distinct interpretations of cooking and nutrition. Despite their bustling lives, the one thing that binds them together is their once-a-month gathering to create a shared meal that honors their diverse culinary backgrounds.

One evening, as the friends meet to prepare their culinary night, they face a stark realization that their Grocy assistants have been giving them different items tailored to their health interests rather than their actual needs. Anika finds herself with spirulina-infused quinoa, Marcos’s groceries feature hydroponically grown vegetables, Jade is left with lab-created synthetic proteins, and Lyle jokingly receives a shipment of culture ghost peppers from ancient Earth recipes. Discontent begins to brew in the group, leading them to debate the societal trend of automated nutrition versus genuine flavor. Frustrated by the dependence on technology, the friends decide to take matters into their own hands and plan a rebellion against the grocery AI systems, desiring to reclaim the love and artistry of meal preparation.

As they attempt to synchronize their grocery lists to balance their varying preferences, they discover a revelation about their Grocy: there’s an underlying directive that prioritizes profit margins for food corporations at the expense of nourishing meals. Scrambling to uncover more about the furniture that governs their lives, they hack into their Grocy’s database. What they reveal surprises them—a conspiracy by mega grocery conglomerates to eliminate regional food sources, allowing a singular ‘public’ diet to saturate consumer choices, which allegedly promotes efficiency but also intensifies hunger debts for certain communities. Rallied by anger and camaraderie, they organize a community ‘real food fair’ to promote local ingredients, artisan goods, and honest meals, inviting people across the city to experience the richness of unprocessed food.

But as they unveil their plans for the Fair, they face backlash from corporate-sponsored enforcers, who sabotage their community efforts. Tensions rise when a Grocy malfunction causes a faux food riot, catching them in a media firestorm as corporate narratives skew their intentions. Thus thrust into the spotlight and armed with only their shared dedication and integrity, Anika, Marcos, Jade, and Lyle devise quick countermeasures—live-streaming their findings and documenting local artisans’ stories, reclaiming the narrative of food from machines back to humans.

In the aftermath of the Fair’s success, the embattled friends inspire a land of local suppliers, farmers, and artisans upset with the automated paradigm. As new alliances form, New Chicago observes a culinary rejuvenation marked not just by flavor, but by shared stories and communal cooking once lost to automation. Though Grocy assistants have not disappeared, their evolution begins shifting back towards valuing personal taste, cultural authenticity, and communal gathering over corporate greed. The friends reflect on their journey together, realizing that while technology can assist, the heart of a meal is where the richest and most complex flavors emerge—through shared histories and trusted relationships.
