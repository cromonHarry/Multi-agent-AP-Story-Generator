In the year 2045, grocery shopping has transformed into a virtual experience where citizens use augmented reality devices to seamlessly navigate large, holographic marketplaces from the comfort of their homes. Food items are tailored to individual health needs and preferences, tracked via personal AI assistants known as GAIAs. Ronan, a tech-savvy but reluctant shopper, lives comfortably in this system.

In a dramatic climax enveloped with digital clashes and cheers from locals, the opening day proves both exhilarating and nerve-racking, with glitches in the avatar representation of competition and celebratory promotions reaching cacophonic levels. Can the community band together to overcome digital obstacles as the initial footfall reveals that every customer outweighs erroneous negativity?

After an astonishing launch, the co-op thrives with food enthusiasts, avoiding breakdown imbalances from corrupted corporate systems.
