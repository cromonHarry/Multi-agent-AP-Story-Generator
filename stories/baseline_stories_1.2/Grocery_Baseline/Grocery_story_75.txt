In a world where virtual reality has seamlessly integrated into everyday life, grocery shopping has become a multi-sensory experience. Consumers wear immersive bio-adaptive helmets that project vibrant environments resembling food markets, each buzzingly alive with digitized produce, artificial scents, and holographic vendors. Claire, a strong-willed grocery logistics officer, works at VatiGro, a pioneering grocery technology company. She strives to enhance the shopping experience while battling public skepticism about the lost authenticity of physical stores. Participating in the launch of VatiGro’s latest AI-driven grocery interface, Claire enlists the help of her best friend Leon, a charismatic taste-philosopher devoted to exploring the emotional connections people have with food. Unknown to them, Maya, a staunch activist for real food systems, is intent on exposing the environmental cost of virtual grocery shopping, seeing it as a distraction from devastating agricultural failures. Then there is Azar, the enigmatic head of VatiGro’s VR department, whose vision of an omnipresent grocery experience has been marred by whispers of data manipulation and invasive marketing.

As the launch day approaches, excitement runs high among the team at VatiGro. Claire immerses herself in backroom briefings with Azar, getting glimpses of a groundbreaking feature soon to be released—an algorithm-driven suggestion system, intertwined with users’ emotional data, to curate personalized shopping experiences designed to boost nostalgia and sentimentality around food history. Meanwhile, Leon aids Claire by discussing the potential implications of connecting consumers’ psychological states to consumer habits, gauging whether they can stimulate communal joy. This growing tension is deepened by Maya organizing protests against VatiGro, advocating the importance of nutritious farming practices and urgent sustainable choices, positioning her as a thorn in their side. As Claire navigates dual loyalties—that to pioneering gourmet food experiences and friendships—she remains unaware that not all her fellow developers share her ethical conviction.
