In the year 2045, the concept of grocery shopping has transformed completely with the advent of the automated bio-market, a virtual space where AI-designed avatars guide consumers through an immersive shopping experience. People don’t just pick brands; they serve up preferences and allergies, and nutrient requirements as holographic simulations flash foods, much like animated advertisements, against a backdrop of engaging storylines about their origin. Maeve, a culinary historian who has dedicated her life to the craft of food and its cultural significance, struggles with this paradigm. Her brother Tyson, a grocery tech entrepreneur, views this evolution as a necessary leap into efficiency and health-centric living, often clashing with Maeve's beliefs that cooking should remain an immersive, tangible experience.

As the brothers debate the shift from kitchens to screens, their neighbor Pat—a hardworking delivery drone mechanic—begins to uncover disturbing glitches in the AI’s assessments and food delivery integrity. The drones, which are supposed to ensure swift and safe delivery of holographic groceries to consumers' homes, start malfunctioning, leading to people receiving products that lack essential nutrients or are even hazardous to consume. Pat's partner, Zara, an ambitious journalist for an influential lifestyle magazine, senses a larger conspiracy at play when customers begin discussing cases of food-related illnesses tied to undisclosed modifications AI systems are making to select popular products. Sensing an explosive story that could shift perceptions on grocery tech, she decides to investigate.

The tension builds as Zara uncovers plans by powerful conglomerates to alter critical nutritional data and market poor quality food products as healthy choices to increase profit margins. Maeve comes to Zara, willing to provide her knowledge on food history and studies that could expose these harmful discrepancies. They represent an old versus new world view, where genuine sustenance clashes with commercialization. Tyson's motivations are revealed through a holographic audience at his company’s annual report, promoting new algorithms intended to ‘enhance consumer satisfaction’, disguising an agenda deeply rooted in nutrient manipulation and financial gain. Both sides mount their final arguments: one for the preservation of cooking as art, and the other as technological necessity.

In the climax, Maeve and Zara infiltrate a hush-hush corporate gala where the big food conglomerates are set to launch their newest range of “AI-culinary enhanced grocery products.” They confront Tyson on stage, unveiling evidence gathered through Zara's investigative work that links generative algorithms to far-reaching population vulnerabilities and systemic health crises involving the very macronutrient balances the companies promised to promote. A raw video exploiting the unseen consequences of these products seals a massive online feed, revealing the grim consequences to consumers who were left completely unaware. 

As public outrage surges, the coalition against corporate governance forms in full backfire. Customers rally for a return to authentic grocery experiences, igniting Maeve’s movement to reallocate her archival work while intertwining younger unearthed cooking methods. Meanwhile, Tyson struggles with confronting the corporate ethos he once promoted. In a promising twist, tech-savvy eateries powered by ethical grocery sourcing begin to emerge alongside nurseries where people are once again learning how to grow their own food. In this new world, people combine apps and authentically sourced groceries by sharing spaces of old community roots with the innovations of tomorrow, reshaping both their food culture and their personal connections to it.
