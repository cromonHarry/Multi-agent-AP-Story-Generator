In the year 2045, grocery shopping has undergone a radical transformation through the development of omnidirectional synthfoods—edible macrospheres customized at a molecular level. In this world, the grocery store has evolved into a virtual reality hub, where people wear augmented reality visors and engage with holographic avatars of farm beings who guide their dietary choices. Our four protagonists live in the bustling metropolis of Neo-Eden: Zara, a cutting-edge food scientist; Malik, a tech-savvy grocery designer; Reiko, a chef seeking to revolutionize culinary experiences; and Armand, a rural farmer struggling to connect with consumers in this high-tech environment.
