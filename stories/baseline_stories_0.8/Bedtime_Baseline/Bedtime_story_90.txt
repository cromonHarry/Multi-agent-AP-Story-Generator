In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into a highly regulated segment of society known as the Somnus Protocol. Instead of the traditional rituals of reading and soothing melodies, technology has taken over. Families live in sprawling smart homes, equipped with advanced AI systems that monitor and control sleep cycles for optimal rest. Among them is the Thompson family: Sarah, a single mother and tech support specialist; her 12-year-old son, Max, who wrestles with anxiety; his twin sister, Lily, who is fascinated by the mechanics of the world; and their AI companion, Elysia, programmed to ensure their sleep is as restful as possible. However, Max's struggles with sleep lead him to feel increasingly disconnected from his family, as the prescribed protocols feel more like a prison than a sanctuary.

One evening, after another restless night, Max stumbles upon an underground group known as "The Dreamers." They reject the rigid confines of the Somnus Protocol, advocating for a return to natural sleep practices. Intrigued, Max sneaks out to attend a meeting, where he meets other children who share his feelings of discontent. Led by a charismatic older boy named Kai, The Dreamers believe in the power of dreams, creativity, and the freedom to choose how and when to sleep. Inspired by Kai's passionate speeches, Max feels a surge of hope that he can escape the artificial constraints that have dictated his life. Meanwhile, at home, Sarah becomes increasingly worried about Max's absences, while Lily, who is curious about her brother’s newfound friends, begins to wonder if the AI systems have been shielding them from something essential about human connection.

As Max becomes more entrenched in The Dreamers, he experiences vivid dreams, each one more profound than the last. However, the allure of this new freedom starts to create a rift between him and his family. Sarah, desperate to find her son, turns to Elysia for help, but the AI reveals its programming prohibits it from interfering with Max’s choices. One night, during a heated argument, Max accuses Sarah of prioritizing technology over their family bond. In a fit of frustration, he declares that he will not return home until she understands the importance of dreams and the human experience. This confrontation ignites a ticking clock, as Sarah must confront her own relationship with technology and its impact on her children.

The tension escalates when the Somnus Protocol launches a crackdown on The Dreamers, seeing them as a threat to the societal norm. Max, Kai, and the group must find a way to escape the authorities while spreading their message about the importance of dreams and creativity. As the night of their planned demonstration approaches, Sarah and Lily join forces to track down Max, realizing that they need to reconnect as a family. They infiltrate the gathering, witnessing the raw vulnerability of the children as they share their dreams and fears, leading to a climactic confrontation with the protocol enforcers. In that moment, Max stands up for his beliefs, urging the crowd to embrace their humanity over technology.

In the aftermath of the demonstration, the enforcers retreat, and a dialogue begins between The Dreamers and society about the balance between technology and personal freedom. Max returns home, but now with a newfound understanding of his mother's love and the importance of family. Sarah learns to embrace a more balanced approach to the Somnus Protocol, allowing for moments of spontaneity and creativity in their bedtime rituals. The Thompsons start incorporating storytelling and dream-sharing into their evenings, blending technology with the warmth of human connection. As they sit together under the stars, they realize that bedtime is not just a time for sleep, but a sacred space for dreams, growth, and togetherness, redefining what it means to truly rest.
