In the year 2045, the concept of “Bedtime” has been radically transformed by advancements in technology and societal reform. Sleep, once considered a natural and necessary human function, has been optimized into an experience dubbed “SomniTech.” Families like the Kims now upload their consciousness into a hyper-realistic virtual environment every night, where they can explore dreams orchestrated by advanced AI. Among the Kims are Mira, a 12-year-old girl excited about her nightly adventures; her overworked father, Jin, who often struggles to balance work and family life; her mother, Lila, a sleep scientist who advocates for natural sleep; and her older brother, Theo, a skeptic of the tech who believes that it’s diminishing real-life connections. As the family prepares for their nightly upload, tension simmers around the table regarding the merits and dangers of this new bedtime routine.

As the Kims enter the virtual realm, they are met with stunning landscapes—their wildest dreams brought to life through vivid colors and limitless possibilities. Yet, as Mira revels in the fantastical worlds, Jin becomes increasingly consumed by his work in the real world, often logging in late or missing family uploads altogether. Lila worries about the implications of their dependence on the tech, voicing concerns about how it may be affecting their relationships, particularly with Theo, who increasingly isolates himself in his virtual world. Seeking to bridge the gap, Lila suggests they try a night of “Unplugged Sleep,” a return to natural rest without the crutch of SomniTech. The family hesitantly agrees, hoping to resolve their growing disconnect.

The night of Unplugged Sleep arrives, and tensions escalate as Mira struggles to understand the allure of reality without the vibrant fantasies she’s grown accustomed to. As the night progresses, Jin fights to stay asleep, plagued by the buzzing notifications of his work email, while Theo finds himself restless, his mind cascading with the colorful images of his recent virtual adventures. Lila attempts to guide them through the quiet, encouraging mindfulness and family bonding, but the atmosphere is thick with frustration. In a moment of emotional outburst, Mira accuses her family of abandoning her in the pursuit of efficiency and productivity, igniting an argument that echoes through the darkened house.

Just as their personal conflicts reach a boiling point, the power goes out, plunging the house into darkness. The absence of technology forces the family to confront their feelings without distractions. One-by-one, they share their experiences, fears, and aspirations, realizing that their connections have suffered in the shadow of convenience. Lila speaks passionately about the need for balance, while Jin acknowledges his preoccupation with work. Mira expresses her need for adventure, and Theo reveals the loneliness he feels despite being surrounded by virtual friends. The raw vulnerability prompts a shift in perspective, revealing the core of their familial bond that had been neglected.

In the days that follow, the Kims work to establish a new bedtime routine that honors both their need for connection and the wonders of imagination. They decide to alternate between SomniTech adventures and Unplugged Sleep, allowing for both escapism and real-world bonding. Significant moments become sacred again—family story nights, shared dreams, and undistracted laughter. Mira feels more secure and loved, Jin finds rejuvenation outside of work, and Lila champions a new approach to sleep science, advocating for holistic well-being. Theo, embracing his role as a bridge between worlds, crafts a digital family album, intertwining their virtual memories with real-life moments. In this harmonious blend, the Kims discover that true bedtime is not just about sleep; it’s about the connections that sustain them through the night and beyond.
