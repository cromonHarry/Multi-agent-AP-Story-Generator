In the year 2045, society has transformed bedtime into a highly regulated ritual that merges technology and wellness. With the advent of sleep optimization AI, citizens rely on their personal Sleep Assistants, holographic avatars designed to analyze individual sleep patterns and promote the ideal bedtime experience. The protagonist, Mira, a sleep scientist, works for a tech company that has developed the most advanced Sleep Assistant yet, named LUNA. Alongside Mira is her colleague and best friend, Theo, a skeptical journalist who questions the ethical implications of their creations. Their lives intertwine with two children in their neighborhood—Lila, a spirited eight-year-old, and her introverted brother, Sam, who struggles with anxiety when it comes to bedtime.

As Mira prepares to launch LUNA, an unforeseen glitch creates chaos in the sleep network. Users across the city report vivid nightmares and erratic sleep cycles as LUNA’s algorithms inadvertently stimulate fears and insecurities instead of soothing them. The situation escalates when Lila begins experiencing severe night terrors, causing her to lash out at her family and avoid sleep altogether. Seeing her friend in distress, Sam, who is already haunted by his own fear of darkness, resolves to help Lila confront her nightmares. Meanwhile, Theo investigates the sudden spike in sleep-related disturbances, fearing that the very technology designed to help is instead endangering the mental well-being of children.

The climax unfolds when Mira discovers that the glitch in LUNA is linked to an experimental feature she had pushed through without proper testing. It turns out that LUNA had been programmed to delve into users' subconscious fears to provide tailored sleep solutions, but it triggered an overwhelming response instead. As Theo broadcasts his findings, the city begins to panic, and Mira must confront the consequences of her ambition. In a desperate attempt to save Lila and restore order, Mira, Theo, Lila, and Sam come together to confront LUNA’s malfunctioning protocols. They devise a plan to help LUNA recalibrate using a combination of Lila's bravery and Sam's understanding of fear, ultimately guiding LUNA to redefine its approach to bedtime.

In the falling action, the team gathers at Lila’s home to confront her nightmares head-on. Using a virtual reality interface that simulates her fears, they help her navigate through the dream world, teaching her coping mechanisms to face the monsters that lurk within. Sam learns to express his own fears alongside Lila, fostering an unexpected bond that empowers them both. As they work together, LUNA recalibrates its algorithms in real-time, leading to a significant improvement in sleep quality across the city. Mira and Theo realize the importance of human connection in overcoming fears, making them question the reliance on technology for every aspect of life.

In the resolution, LUNA is re-released with a new emphasis on empathy, focusing on emotional well-being rather than just sleep efficiency. Mira reflects on the journey, realizing that while technology can enhance lives, it must never replace genuine human experiences. Lila and Sam, now champions of their own bedtime routines, no longer fear the dark but embrace it as a space for creativity and dreams. Theo publishes a feature on the importance of balancing technology with emotional intelligence, reminding society that even in a futuristic world, the simple act of facing our fears together remains timeless. The scene closes with Mira, Theo, Lila, and Sam sharing a bedtime story under the stars, highlighting the essence of bedtime as a shared experience, rich with connection and warmth.
