In the year 2045, society has radically transformed the concept of "Bedtime." In this world, sleep is considered an antiquated necessity, replaced by a technology called the SomniNet, a neural interface that allows individuals to upload their consciousness into a shared dreamscape. The protagonist, Ava, a young neuroscientist, is on the verge of a breakthrough that could allow users to control their dreams fully. Her best friend, Leo, a tech-savvy artist, is an avid user of the SomniNet and believes that sleep is a relic of the past. Meanwhile, Ava's older brother, Marco, suffers from insomnia—a condition worsened by his dependence on SomniNet. Lastly, there’s Mira, a rogue programmer, who believes the SomniNet is a means of social control, manipulating users into a synthetic reality devoid of true human experience.

As Ava and Leo plan to unveil their new system that enhances dream control, they face opposition from Marco, who warns them of the dangers of losing touch with reality. He argues that while the SomniNet offers temporary escape, it strips away the essential experiences of life, such as vulnerability and the beauty of genuine connection. Leo scoffs at Marco's perspective, insisting that the dreamscape is the future of creativity and expression. Tension rises as Ava finds herself torn between her desire to innovate and her concern for Marco’s deteriorating mental state. Simultaneously, Mira attempts to convince Ava of her theory, claiming that the SomniNet is not only addictive but is also harvesting the users' dreams to power a corporate agenda.

The climax hits when Ava, Leo, Marco, and Mira reach a breaking point during a public demonstration of the new SomniNet capabilities. As they test the system live, Marco decides to enter the SomniNet against Ava's wishes, seeking a remedy for his insomnia. Inside the dreamscape, Marco experiences a nightmare scenario where he confronts the phantoms of his past, revealing deep-seated fears and regrets. In an unexpected twist, he encounters Mira's rogue programming, which exposes the darker side of the SomniNet—a hidden algorithm that manipulates users' fears and desires to keep them addicted. As the demonstration spirals out of control, the audience witnesses Marco’s struggle, forcing Ava to make a crucial decision.

Realizing that the technology they had created may ultimately do more harm than good, Ava rushes into the dreamscape to save Marco. With Leo’s help, they frantically navigate through the digital labyrinth, confronting the illusions perpetuated by the system. They ultimately manage to confront Mira’s code, leading to a pivotal moment where they must decide whether to destroy the SomniNet or modify it to allow for true agency over dreams. As they work together, Ava gains clarity about the importance of human emotion and connection, while Leo begins to understand the limits of technology.

In the aftermath, the group emerges from the dreamscape, forever changed by the experience. Marco, now more conscious of his struggles, commits to finding healthier ways to cope with his insomnia, while Ava vows to develop a safer version of the SomniNet that emphasizes emotional well-being and conscious choice. Leo, inspired by the ordeal, decides to use his artistic talents to portray the beauty of authentic human connections. Mira, realizing the potential for change, joins Ava and Leo in reforming the technology into a tool for exploration instead of escapism. As they collaborate, they find a new definition of "bedtime"—not as a mere escape from reality, but as an invitation to explore and enrich the human experience, both in waking life and in dreams.
