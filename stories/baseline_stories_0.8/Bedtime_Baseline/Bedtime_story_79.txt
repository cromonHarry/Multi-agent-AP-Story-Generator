In the year 2045, society has embraced a radical transformation of bedtime, turning it into a digital experience. Rather than the traditional ritual of sleeping in a bed, people now "upload" themselves into immersive dreamscapes through neural implants. These dreamscapes are customized environments where individuals can live out their fantasies or explore their subconscious. The concept of sleep has become obsolete, replaced by the idea of ‘droning’—a term used to describe the act of engaging with these virtual realms. Among the few who resist this digital slumber is Mara, a freelance historian battling insomnia, and her childhood friend, Theo, an ambitious dream architect who creates these worlds. They are joined by Ruby, a curious teenager who is drawn to the allure of the dreamscapes, and Jasper, an anti-tech activist trying to rally people against the perils of digital slumber.

Mara’s insomnia leads her to dig deeper into the historical roots of sleep and its psychological effects. As she researches, she uncovers alarming data about the psychological toll of prolonged droning—communities suffering from collective nightmares and existential crises. Meanwhile, Theo, enamored with his creations, struggles to balance his artistic vision with the ethical implications of his work. Ruby, who has just begun to experience the dreamscapes, finds herself captivated by the allure of a perfect, alternate reality, unaware of the dangers that lurk within. As Mara shares her findings with Theo, she becomes increasingly concerned about the impact of dream addiction on society, igniting a debate between their perspectives.

One evening, as the four friends gather for a rare face-to-face meeting, the conversation spirals into a heated argument. Mara confronts Theo about the moral responsibility of dream architects, insisting that the dreamscapes are altering the way people perceive reality. Ruby, caught in the middle, declares her love for the escapism and the joy it brings her. Jasper chimes in, urging them to consider the erosion of genuine human connection, a byproduct of their obsession with droning. The tension culminates in a challenge: they decide to confront the dreamscape’s dark underbelly by entering one of Theo’s experimental worlds designed to amplify fears and traumas. Their goal is to not only understand the emotional impact but also to expose the flaws in the system.

As they enter the dreamscape, they find themselves trapped in a surreal labyrinth that manifests their deepest insecurities. Mara faces her fear of inadequacy, Theo confronts the consequences of his creations, Ruby is forced to reckon with her addiction to perfection, and Jasper experiences the loneliness of isolation. Together, they navigate the twisted corridors of their minds, battling both internal and external forces in a race against time. Each character is pushed to their limits as they watch the dreamscape tear at the seams of their shared friendship, revealing the fragility of their connections. Just as despair threatens to overwhelm them, they find strength in unity, working together to face their fears and break free from the clutches of the labyrinth.

Emerging from the dreamscape, the four friends are forever changed. They realize the importance of genuine connection, vowing to prioritize their friendships over the fleeting pleasures of digital escapism. Theo decides to alter his dream architectures to encourage meaningful interactions rather than mere indulgence. Ruby, having experienced the harsh realities of her desires, pledges to seek balance between fantasy and reality. Meanwhile, Mara’s newfound insights inspire her to write a book about the history and evolution of bedtime, aiming to educate others on the value of real sleep and authentic relationships. As the sun rises over the city, they sit together, appreciating the simple beauty of being awake, together in a world that still needs the warmth of genuine connection.
