In the year 2045, the world has become obsessed with optimizing every aspect of life, and sleep has transformed into a highly regulated event known as "Bedtime." Smart technology has integrated with biology, creating a society where individuals can choose to upload their consciousness into a virtual dreamscape, experiencing personalized adventures while their bodies recharge. The protagonist, Lila, a sleep technician, works at the Bedtime Nexus, a facility that curates these experiences. She is joined by her childhood friend Max, an activist advocating for natural sleep, and their neighbor, Zara, a high-powered executive whose life revolves around performance. The fourth character, Rami, is a rebellious programmer who believes that the code governing the dreamscapes is flawed and has hidden dangers.

As Lila meticulously prepares the clients for their bedtime journeys, she begins to notice anomalies in the dreamscapes—the same strange glitch that Rami had warned her about. Meanwhile, Max rallies a group of individuals who reject the technological dependency of sleep, insisting that true rest is being sacrificed for pleasure and productivity. Tensions rise within the community as more people elect to abandon their biological sleep in favor of the virtual. While Lila grapples with the ethics of her work, she discovers that the glitches are not mere technical issues but reflect the emotional turmoil of the dreamers, revealing secrets buried deep within their psyches. Pushed by Max's fervor, Lila becomes conflicted about her role in perpetuating the system.

The climax unfolds when a massive malfunction strikes the Bedtime Nexus during a peak operation, trapping hundreds of clients inside their dreamscapes. Lila, Max, Zara, and Rami band together to confront the crisis. Rami hacks into the system to regain control, revealing that the glitches are manifestations of the users' unresolved traumas. They discover that the corporation behind the Nexus has been exploiting these traumas to maintain control over clients' experiences and enhance dependency on the service. With time running out, the group must navigate both the chaotic dream environments and their own fears, confronting personal traumas in a race against the clock.

As they delve deeper, the boundaries between their realities blur. Lila faces her past—her estranged relationship with her father, who had succumbed to the allure of virtual sleep. Max confronts the loss of his sister, who disappeared into a dream just months prior. Zara’s perfect façade crumbles, revealing her struggles with the expectations placed upon her. Rami, feeling the weight of the system's corruption, becomes their guide, leading them to a solution that reclaims the dreamscapes. They manage to pull the clients out, but not without a cost, as Lila realizes she must let go of her past to help others.

In the aftermath, the group emerges from the chaos, forever changed by their experiences. Lila decides to leave her position at the Bedtime Nexus, advocating for a return to natural sleep and the importance of facing one’s reality. Max and the activists gain momentum, leading a movement that emphasizes holistic wellness over technological shortcuts. Zara, having shed her corporate persona, begins to explore what it means to connect genuinely with others. Rami, now hailed as a hero, dedicates himself to ensuring that technology serves humanity, not the other way around. As the darkness of night falls, they gather to embrace the beauty of unfiltered sleep, sharing stories and laughter, reclaiming bedtime as a sacred space for rest, reflection, and genuine connection.
