In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transcended its traditional roots, reshaped by technological advancements and societal changes. People no longer sleep in the conventional sense; instead, they enter a state of "Rest Mode," facilitated by BioSync Pods—high-tech capsules that stimulate the brain with soothing neural waves. Talia, a restless teenager, struggles with her nightly experiences in the pod, while her mother, Dr. Elara Kane, a renowned neuroscientist, is a leading figure in the Sleep Enhancement Project. Talia's younger brother, Finn, finds solace in the artificial dreams generated by the pods, believing they are more vivid than reality. Their father, Marco, a programmer, has grown concerned about the psychological effects of the pods and the growing dependence on artificial sleep.

As Talia becomes increasingly frustrated with the mind-altering dreams provided by the pods, she begins to explore an underground movement that advocates for natural sleep. This group, calling themselves the "Sleepless," believes that the essence of humanity lies in authentic dreams and the natural rhythm of sleep. Finn, enamored with the joys of the engineered dreams, initially dismisses Talia’s concerns. Meanwhile, Dr. Kane is torn between her commitment to her research and her growing worries about her children’s wellbeing. Marco secretly supports Talia’s quest, as he recalls fond memories of bedtime stories and the magic of a well-earned sleep. Talia’s nightly treks into the depths of the Sleepless movement lead her to a hidden enclave, where she encounters others who share her desire for a more organic experience of Rest Mode.

The tension escalates when Talia decides to test the limits of the BioSync Pod by refusing to use it, choosing instead to stay awake in the natural world. As she struggles through sleepless nights, her health deteriorates, and her family becomes alarmed. Finn, witnessing his sister's decline, begins to question his own reliance on the pods and longs for their childhood bond, which had been overshadowed by the allure of the BioSync’s artificial comfort. Dr. Kane faces a moral crisis, caught between her dedication to scientific progress and her maternal instinct to protect her children. Marco’s growing anxiety culminates in a confrontation with Dr. Kane, where he begs her to reconsider the ethics of their work, pushing her to join Talia’s cause.

In a desperate attempt to save Talia, the family bands together, rallying against the powerful corporations behind the BioSync technology. They infiltrate a corporate event showcasing the latest advancements in sleep technology, where tensions reach a boiling point. Talia takes the stage, passionately advocating for the return to natural sleep and authentic dreaming, igniting a fierce debate among the audience. Her speech resonates with many, but corporate representatives retaliate, branding her a threat to progress. The situation spirals out of control, leading to a chaotic confrontation that forces everyone to face the consequences of their choices.

Ultimately, Talia's courage ignites a revolutionary movement for the right to choose one’s sleep experience. The family becomes icons of the Sleepless movement, advocating for balance between technology and nature. Dr. Kane, driven by her children’s plight, redirects her research towards safer, more holistic sleep solutions. Finn, transformed by his sister’s struggle, begins to explore the wonders of natural dreams, reestablishing his bond with Talia. As their family finds solace in shared stories and authentic experiences, they redefine "Bedtime" not as a mere routine, but as a sacred ritual—a time to reconnect with each other and the essence of being human.
