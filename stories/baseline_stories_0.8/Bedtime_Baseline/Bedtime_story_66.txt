In the year 2045, the concept of bedtime has transformed into a complex ritual that is powered by advanced technology and societal pressures. In this world, sleep is no longer merely a restorative necessity but a competitive and quantifiable element of life. The Sleep Optimization Society (SOS) has developed smart pods that analyze sleep patterns and optimize rest through tailored soundscapes, light frequencies, and even biofeedback. Four friends, Ava, Marlon, Lila, and Tariq, navigate this landscape, each approaching bedtime with distinct challenges: Ava is obsessed with achieving the perfect sleep score, while Marlon struggles with insomnia. Lila, a champion sleeper, becomes the envy of their group, and Tariq, who works for SOS, grapples with the ethics of commodifying rest.

As the friends gather for their weekly game night, discussions about sleep scores become increasingly competitive. Ava reveals her new sleep pod, boasting a 98% efficiency rating, while Marlon shares his frustrations with an ever-slipping score. Lila effortlessly bests them both with her natural sleeping ability, and they tease Tariq for his work in the industry that fuels their anxieties. However, the lighthearted banter takes a turn when they learn about a new SOS initiative: a city-wide competition where participants can win cash and status for the highest sleep score. Fueled by ambition and the desire to outshine one another, the friends decide to enter the competition, igniting a race toward optimal rest that threatens to strain their relationships.

As the competition begins, each character adopts extreme measures to enhance their sleep. Ava becomes increasingly ritualistic, isolating herself from social interactions to fine-tune her environment, while Marlon experiments with various sleep aids, each more potent than the last. Lila, feeling the pressure to maintain her status, begins manipulating her scores through deceitful means, while Tariq battles with his conscience, realizing that the technology he promotes might actually be harming them. Tensions rise among the friends as they challenge each other’s ethics and commitment to the competition, leading to a series of confrontations that test their bonds and reveal deep-seated insecurities.

The climax unfolds during the final sleep assessment, where each of them must achieve their highest score yet. Ava’s intense focus leads to sleepless nights, leaving her exhausted and vulnerable. Marlon, on the verge of a breakdown, ironically finds solace in his friends and shares his struggles during a rare moment of connection. Lila’s facade crumbles as her unethical practices are exposed, resulting in public humiliation. Tariq, witnessing the fallout, must confront the implications of the SOS’s influence on their lives and decides to sabotage the competition to prevent further damage. In a moment of unity, the friends band together to dismantle the competitive framework of the competition, realizing that friendship and authenticity are far more valuable than scores.

In the aftermath, the friends find a new perspective on sleep, rejecting the societal pressures that once consumed them. They form a support group dedicated to promoting healthy sleep habits without the competitive edge of the previous system. With the SOS facing backlash from the public due to the competition’s fallout, they pivot to community-driven initiatives that emphasize holistic rest and well-being. The friends rebuild their connections through shared, technology-free sleep rituals—storytelling, meditation, and group naps—putting the joy back into bedtime. In this brave new world, they redefine what it means to rest, cherishing the simple act of sleeping as an essential part of life rather than a battleground for status and achievement.
