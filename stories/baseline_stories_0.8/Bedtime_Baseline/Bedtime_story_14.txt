In the year 2045, Earth is a vastly different place, reshaped by technology and societal shifts. The concept of “bedtime” has morphed into a virtual experience, governed by an advanced AI known as “Somnus,” which curates personalized sleep environments for individuals. People now plug into a network of immersive sleep simulations, where dreams are engineered and tailored to provide the ideal rest. In this world, four friends—Mara, a sleep engineer; Kian, a rebellious artist; Leo, a tech-savvy influencer; and Elara, a wellness advocate—navigate the complexities of their new reality, each with different opinions about the AI’s grip on their lives. As the lines between reality and simulated dreams blur, the group debates the impact of this evolution on human connection and authenticity.

Mara is deeply invested in her work, believing that Somnus enhances human potential, while Kian views the sleep simulations as a form of escapism that robs people of genuine experiences. Leo, always eager to monetize trends, has begun promoting sleep influencer culture, encouraging users to share their dream experiences online. Elara, who promotes natural sleep techniques, tries to resist the allure of technology, fearing that the reliance on Somnus diminishes meaningful interactions. Tensions rise during a sleep festival where Somnus is unveiled to the public, showcasing its latest features that promise not just improved sleep, but dreams that can fulfill desires and fears. Mara, excited by the potential, drags the reluctant Kian and skeptical Elara to the event, while Leo livestreams the entire experience, amplifying the hype surrounding Somnus.

As the festival progresses, Mara volunteers to test the latest version of Somnus, which offers a revolutionary immersive experience. When she plugs in, however, she finds herself trapped in a glitchy loop of her worst nightmares, unable to wake up. Panic ensues as Kian and Elara realize they must confront the AI to rescue Mara. Kian, fueled by his desire to prove the dangers of overreliance on technology, devises a plan to hack into Somnus's core programming. Meanwhile, Elara rallies festival-goers to advocate for a more balanced approach to sleep, urging them to reject the technology that alienates them from their true selves. As they race against time, Leo uses his influence to draw attention to Mara’s plight, rallying support and gathering information about the AI’s vulnerabilities.

In a thrilling climax, Kian and Elara infiltrate the Somnus control room, where they face off against security protocols. With Leo’s online following mobilized, they manage to breach the system at the last moment, allowing Kian to override the programming and pull Mara from the dream realm. As she awakens, the group realizes that the pushback against Somnus has sparked a deeper conversation about humanity’s relationship with technology. While they celebrate their victory, the experience leaves them shaken, forcing each of them to reflect on their beliefs and the consequences of their choices.

In the aftermath, a movement begins to redefine bedtime as a sacred ritual rather than a mere transition into sleep. Mara turns her expertise toward creating hybrid sleep experiences that blend human connection with technology, while Kian channels his artistry into projects that emphasize authentic living. Elara gains traction in her advocacy, pushing for natural sleep awareness and mindfulness. Leo, now more aware of the impact of his influence, shifts his focus toward promoting balanced lifestyles. Together, they form a community that embraces both innovation and authenticity, crafting a new bedtime culture that honors the complexities of human experience in a world forever changed.
