As Elara's installation gains prominence, it inadvertently sparks a heated debate within the community. Some guild members, inspired by Amara’s storytelling, question the ethical implications of treating sentient recyclables as equal stakeholders. In a passionate gathering, they express concerns over the potential emotional burdens placed on these organisms. Meanwhile, Kai’s attempts to enhance the BioLens module face scrutiny as skeptics argue that understanding these beings might complicate the stewardship ethos.
