In the chaotic metropolis of 2145, Evan Kade stands within the vibrant Umbrella Zone he helped design, surrounded by bioluminescent holographic projections that narrate the struggles and triumphs of the community. With every brushstroke on the digital canvas, he transforms personal stories into art that connects the emotionally fragmented populace, fostering resilience through shared experiences. Nearby, Layla Jivaro facilitates a dialogue session, using the AI-enhanced environment to encourage open discussions about trauma and hope, while Aiko Tanaka tirelessly works on refining the AI that adapts these shelters to be more responsive to emotional needs.
