As tensions rise, Kai Eldridge orchestrates a DreamCollective conference aimed at addressing the 'Sleep Integrity Paradox,' inviting a diverse assembly of dreamers to share their experiences.

As the DreamCollective conference reaches its peak, a sudden blackout plunges the venue into darkness, a sabotage orchestrated by Zarek Flint and his followers. In the ensuing chaos, the emotional turmoil among attendees escalates, with heightened tensions reflecting the 'Sleep Integrity Paradox'—those with access to DreamVessels feeling threatened, while those without feel a fierce longing for connection and recognition.

Nyra documents the emotional evolution of the community, capturing their shared resilience and newfound solidarity. Zarek, witnessing the power of their united front, realizes the potential in collaboration rather than rebellion.
