In the year 2145, the world thrives amid the eco-dentistry revolution, where dental care intertwines with environmental sustainability. Dr. Liora Vandorn actively promotes her high-tech clinic known as the 'Oral Sanctuary,' utilizing advanced AI and nanobots to optimize oral health while advocating for underserved populations to access similar care. Meanwhile, community health activist Milo Takahashi uses digital platforms to rally support, drawing attention to the stark inequalities that plague the dental landscape. Zara Elixis designs immersive VR experiences that challenge traditional perceptions of oral health, pushing the narrative that art can inspire preventive habits. As AI-99, known as Aria, gathers data on evolving patient needs, ethical dilemmas provoke discussions on autonomy and surveillance in healthcare, reflecting a society grappling with a divided yet hopeful future.

As the eco-dentistry revolution gains momentum, a pivotal moment occurs when Dr. Liora Vandorn hosts a groundbreaking symposium to bridge the gap between her affluent Oral Sanctuary and underserved communities.
