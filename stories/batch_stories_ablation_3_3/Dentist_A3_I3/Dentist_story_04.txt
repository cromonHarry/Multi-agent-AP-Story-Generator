In 2145, the skyline of Neo-Tropolis is dominated by gleaming biotech hubs, where elite citizens revel in advanced dental enhancements thanks to gene stamps. Amidst the sterile beauty of their nectar-hued smile pods, a shadow of discontent simmers in the streets below. Dr. Elara Nox, fueled by her family's dental struggles, rises as the voice of the Oral Justice Movement, advocating vehemently for equitable access to bioregenerative treatments. Meanwhile, Kael Marrow channels his experiences with a stark digital art exhibition that sparks passionate debates on tooth equity. Jax Vallow operates in the murky underground, spraying 'Decal Revolution' on walls as a rallying cry against oppressive systems. As Astra Turing integrates AI ethics into public dialogues, tensions escalate, and the urgent call for the 'Teeth Amendment' looms, reflecting the anguish and aspirations of a divided society seeking dental justice.

As the Oral Justice Movement gains traction, the government announces a controversial trial for a new dental gene stamping procedure, accessible only to the wealthy. This sparks outrage among the underprivileged, leading to a massive protest organized by Dr. Elara Nox and backed by Kael Marrow's impactful holographic displays revealing stark health inequalities. During the protest, a confrontation arises when security forces attempt to disperse the crowd, resulting in a splintering event where Jax Vallow and his underground network leap into action, providing immediate dental care to the injured. In the chaos, Astra Turing hacks into the surveillance drones, exposing hidden truths and shifting public sentiment, deepening the divide and catalyzing the urgent need for the 'Teeth Amendment.'

In the electrifying climax, Dr. Elara Nox spearheads a final, desperate march to the corporate headquarters of NovaDent, where the gene stamping procedure is about to be unveiled. With Kael Marrow’s holographic projections illuminating the façade of the building, Jax Vallow secretly leads a guerrilla team inside, determined to sabotage the installation and liberate access codes to the new treatment. Amid escalating chaos, Astra Turing unleashes an AI-driven revelation to the public, unmasking the corporation's corrupt maneuvers and rallying the masses. The air crackles with tension as elites are confronted with the reality of their dental disparity, igniting a citywide rebellion for the imminent 'Teeth Amendment'.

In the aftermath of the rebellion, Dr. Elara Nox stands before a sea of supporters, their voices echoing with hope for the 'Teeth Amendment.' Amidst the ruins of the NovaDent headquarters, Jax Vallow channels his inner guerrilla spirit, organizing makeshift clinics to aid the injured while graffitiing empowering murals for change. Kael Marrow captures this pivotal moment through dynamic holographic displays, celebrating community resilience. Astra Turing navigates the delicate balance of AI ethics, now more crucial than ever as she collaborates with grassroots collectives to reshape future healthcare guidelines. The city's pulse resonates with a collective determination; the movement has awakened a profound realization—the fight for dental justice is far from over, but change is within their grasp.

As the Teeth Amendment passes, Dr. Elara Nox stands triumphant, the symbol of a new era in dental equity. Communities celebrate, and bioregenerative clinics are now accessible to all, dismantling the class barriers in oral health. Kael Marrow's holographic art transforms into a visual testament of their struggles and victories, serving as a reminder of the power of collective action. Jax Vallow, now leading community clinics, finds purpose in empowering others with knowledge and care. Astra Turing continues her vital work in AI ethics, ensuring fair access to technology. The movement's legacy is cemented, fostering hope for a just future where oral health is a shared right, not a privilege.
