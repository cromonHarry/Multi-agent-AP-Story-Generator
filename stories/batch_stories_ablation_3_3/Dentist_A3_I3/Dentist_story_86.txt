As tensions escalate in Neo-Dentropolis, a viral AR performance art piece created by Rina ignites outrage against the elitism surrounding dental health, showcasing the stark disparity in access to bioprinting technology. Dr. Lila partners with Harper and the underground coalition to strategize a protest aimed at a prominent dental expo, where Evan is set to unveil groundbreaking enhancements.
