In response, Ronan rallies supporters at a Denta-Garden forum, encouraging residents to share their positive experiences with the cooperative model. Dr. Keystone passionately articulates the benefits of holistic health, emphasizing its alignment with ecological balance while Mira engages the audience through immersive VR scenarios that illustrate sustainable practices. The community stands united, advocating for their vision of accessible health care, but the threat of Greer's influence looms, prompting the team to craft a robust plan to illustrate the efficacy of their methods.

Just as Hoxton Greer attempts to sow doubt, Lila turns the tide by proposing an open challenge: a live cooperative demonstration against traditional methods. The crowd erupts in a mix of hope and determination, signaling a pivotal showdown between holistic healing and traditional dental practices.

In the aftermath of the climactic demonstration, the atmosphere at the Denta-Garden is charged with renewed hope and vigor.
