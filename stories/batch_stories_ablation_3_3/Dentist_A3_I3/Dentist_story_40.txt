Meanwhile, underground artist Tobias 'Toby' Grayson captures the struggles of the marginalized through evocative street art, aiming to inspire a resurgence of authentic beauty in a world steeped in dental aesthetics.

As tensions mount between the elite and the Nano-Rebellions, Dr. Leila Amsel organizes a symposium to foster dialogue between opposing factions, inviting both the polished elites and grassroots advocates. Despite her noble intentions, the event erupts into chaos when Kiran stages a daring protest, using drones to project images of natural smiles over the gleaming ads of genetically optimized teeth. Meanwhile, Rhea grapples with her complicity in reinforcing these standards as she secretly meets with Toby, who shares his underground methods for reclaiming dental authenticity through art. Their clandestine plans spark an unexpected alliance that could shift the balance of power and redefine beauty standards in society.

The climax reaches a fever pitch during the 'Spectacle of Smiles' event curated by elites, where Dr. Leila Amsel has received a controversial invitation to speak on dental equity.

Toby’s art floods the walls, galvanizing the crowd into a passionate argument, challenging them to choose between elitist perfection and lively authenticity, ultimately bending the tide of public sentiment against the elitist dental regime.
