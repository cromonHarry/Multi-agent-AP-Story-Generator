As the annual 'Luminous Smiles Festival' approaches, tensions rise between Elysia and Kairo. Elysia organizes a workshop promoting collective learning and wellness, urging participants to embrace their bioluminescent smiles as symbols of community resilience.

In the aftermath of the 'Luminous Smiles Festival', vibrations of change ripple through the community.
