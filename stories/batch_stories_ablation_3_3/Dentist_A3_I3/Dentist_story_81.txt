In the dazzling, bioluminescent corridors of the Dental Gallery, the ornate tapestries of human expression through smiles take center stage, heralding a new era in 2142. Dr. Lyra Novék, the Chief Smile Curator, orchestrates an immersive oral care festival, embodying her vision of ethical engagement in dental aesthetics. Amidst the vibrant crowds, Rico Valez addresses his admirers, passionately advocating for the return to natural beauty as he scrutinizes the rising percentage of enhancements. Across the gallery, Aurora 'Rory' Blume showcases her crystalline creations, intertwining art and bio-enhancements, igniting a dialogue on societal perceptions. Meanwhile, Eli Sinclaire, fueled by shared stories, surveys the divide, discerning the undercurrents of Dental Segregation Urbanism that threaten their harmonious utopia.

As the oral care festival unfolds, tensions escalate when Rico Valez publicly challenges the legitimacy of Dr. Lyra Novék's enhancements, sparking a heated debate that resonates throughout the Dental Gallery. Eli Sinclaire, sensing the gathering storm, intervenes, urging the Council to facilitate a dialogue between the factions to promote understanding. Meanwhile, Aurora Blume seizes the moment, crafting an impromptu art performance that illustrates the beauty of both traditional and enhanced smiles, drawing the crowd's attention. The Council, now pressured, proposes a collaborative event to foster dialogue, prompting Rico and Aurora to reluctantly agree, aware that the chasm between Naturals and Crytals threatens to fracture their society.

In the midst of the festival, tensions reach a boiling point as Rico and Aurora, guided by Dr. Novék and Eli, stand before a captivated audience ready to explore the rift between Naturals and Crytals. Rico's fervent defense of natural beauty clashes with Aurora's fiery advocacy for bio-enhancements, echoing through the Dental Gallery's luminous arches. Dr. Novék, sensing the fracture, proposes an audacious idea: a collaborative art piece featuring both their smiles, symbolizing unity amidst diversity. As they begin to sculpt their opposing visions, the air crackles with energy—art becomes a battleground for ideas as the community watches, uncertain of the path that lies ahead, aware that the outcome could redefine their cultural identity forever.
