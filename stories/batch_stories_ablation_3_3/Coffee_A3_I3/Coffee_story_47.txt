Here, coffee transcends mere consumption, becoming a powerful living currency of identity and belonging, shaping a world driven by shared narratives.

As Liora Voss prepares for the grand launch of her 'Café Kaleidoscope,' anticipation ripples through Neo-Terra. However, tensions rise when a rival neuro-curator threatens to undermine her vision by introducing a competing coffee experience that exploits the emotional load of nostalgia without fostering genuine connection.
