In the bustling heart of the year 2147, Juno Marquez stands at the entrance of a vibrant synaptic lounge, Café Synapse, where the air is rich with the aroma of Cognacafé. Passionate about bridging tradition and technology, she prepares to speak at an open forum addressing the urgent issue of cognitive fairness. Inside, Ezra Kint fine-tunes an augmented reality experience, eager to unveil his latest creation that will allow patrons to immerse themselves in ancestral stories while savoring their brew.
