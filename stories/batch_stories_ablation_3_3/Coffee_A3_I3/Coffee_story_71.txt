As the first annual 'Cognitive Equity Festival' approaches, tensions rise in Neo-Arcadia. Lia gathers local baristas and community leaders, urging them to advocate for affordable Cognition Capsules as she faces fierce resistance from corporate sponsors and elite coffee establishments. Concurrently, Rendall publishes a provocative article unveiling the stark divide between those who can afford neuroenhancements and those who cannot, sparking protests. In response, Yura mobilizes governmental support for legislation to ensure equitable access, while Mira creates a series of installations aimed at fostering dialogue within divided neighborhoods. The festival becomes a battleground for ideologies, forcing the characters to confront their values and the future of communal coffee culture.
