As news spreads of a corporate giant, NexusCorp, preparing to launch a synthetic coffee variant that promises hyper-efficiency and universal appeal, Ayla, Ronan, Elara, and Cyrus convene an urgent meeting at the community brew house. Ayla passionately argues for preserving traditional practices, pointing out the importance of emotional authenticity in each brew.
