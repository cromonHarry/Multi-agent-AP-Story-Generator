As the city of Luminara rises to the challenges posed by the surge of shared cognitive experiences, a shocking incident of emotional theft disrupts the harmony of the community. During one of Lara's performances, a rogue hacker exploits the neural networks, hijacking a collective emotional wave and manipulating attendees' feelings for personal gain.
