In the year 2145, recycling has transformed into a high-tech industry known as Reboot, where citizens casually submit their waste through neural-linked devices that analyze and repurpose materials independently. In the bustling city of Neo-Phoenix, the community thrives on a culture of sustainability and innovation. Garen, an ambitious and tech-savvy waste collector, joins forces with Lira, a rebellious artist who uses recycled materials for her powerful installations. Together, they navigate the challenges and implications of this hyper-efficient recycling system. Also part of their group is Tallo, a seasoned Reboot technician, who is skeptical of the system’s moral implications, and Myra, a resourceful journalist, who investigates a disturbing trend of missing recyclable materials.

As Garen and Lira collaborate on an art piece for the upcoming city festival, Tallo opens their eyes to troubling rumors of an underground organization selling high-value recyclables to the black market instead of repurposing them. Intrigued, Myra reaches out to the trio, having uncovered evidence that several influential figures in Neo-Phoenix are involved in the illicit trade. With a looming deadline for the festival, Garen, Lira, Tallo, and Myra grasp the opportunity to confront the moral implications of their city's pride while determining who they can trust amidst deception and greed. Their investigation leads them deep into the workings of Reboot, uncovering a world dominated by numerical algorithms, where suffering is hidden behind layers of clean, digitized processes.

The tensions mount when the group attempts to infiltrate a secret Reboot facility linked to the black market. Inside, they stumble upon shocking technology that facilitates the theft of valuable recyclable materials hired by a conglomerate that seeks to profit from environmental degradation. In a race against time, Garen utilizes his technical skills while Lira captures their discoveries on film. As they delve deeper, they are confronted by security drones and those loyal to the black market's operations. Just when it appears that they might be captured, Tallo’s intimate knowledge of Reboot’s security systems saves them, enabling their daring escape, but not without one final act of bravery as he sacrifices himself for the rest.

In the aftermath, Garen, Lira, and Myra emerge changed. The underground's dark truth needs to be exposed, leading them to release their findings to the public through an explosive report. As the Nexxiom Corporation—the notorious group behind the illicit trade—becomes paramount in the media, citizens rally together, demanding transparency in the Reboot system. Meanwhile, Tallo’s sacrifice is honored as the city transforms its recycling code, enforcing ethical practices in the industry. Garen, Lira, and Myra find purpose in advocating for the unseen networks of support structures that are essential to sustaining their community without corruption.

Reboot is dismantled but reconstructed, focusing on genuine local empowerment and collaborations instead of profit-driven schemes. With transparency restored, Garen and Lira lead a movement to use art as a platform for change, inspiring future generations to regard waste as a resource. Empowered by Tallo’s legacy, Myra proposes an initiative encouraging citizens to contribute not only through their recyclables but also through kindness and cooperation to better the fabric of their society. Together, they shift the public narrative towards what it means to truly recycle, affirming that in their efforts to create a sustainable future, the heart of the community remains vital amidst the detritus of their past.
