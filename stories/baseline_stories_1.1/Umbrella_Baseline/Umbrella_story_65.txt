In the year 2145, Earth has transformed under the weight of catastrophic climate events spurred by centuries of neglect. Major cities are bound by gray skies, and notionally "safe zones" are enclosed in massive domes known as "Umbrellas." These structures, created by an advanced company that offers protection from the harsh realities outside, have become a blend of commerce, social experimentation, and technology. Four residents of New Haven, one such Umbrella-city, find themselves intertwined within this complicated web. Aaliyah, a daring environmental scientist, struggles against the complacency of society. Kael, a cynical security officer, works to maintain the order within the Umbrella but has seen firsthand the rapid decline of the world beyond. Minoo, an entrepreneurial hacker, capitalizes on the systemic flaws in the Umbrella’s security to gather data on what lies beyond. Lastly, Jonah, a charismatic journalist, is intent on exposing truths hidden behind the enclaves, believing the Umbrellas are more oppressive than protective.

Tension simmered beneath the pristine surface as Aaliyah discovers alarming evidence of resource hoarding by the Umbrella Corporation, which risks creating a complete societal collapse. With her fears growing, she confides in Kael, who initially dismisses her concerns but eventually stumbles upon disturbing reports of climate shocks happening more frequently outside the protective dome. Minoo, observing the growing unrest through the eyes of his smuggled drones, intervenes by assigning Aaliyah and Kael to a covert mission. They must venture outside into the chaotic, resource-starved world to retrieve a rumored device capable of mapping ecological changes. Joined reluctantly by Jonah, who is allured by the potential media storm, their crew is poised to uncover not only the truth about their constrained existence but also personal destinies intertwined by the ever-looming danger.

As their mission begins, the group is faced with fierce weather conditions and mutated wildlife birthed from the unchecked experiments of the Umbrella Corporation. They navigate through remnants of old technology and landscapes unrecognizable, all the while Minoo remotely documents their findings and crafts updates for public distribution. One fateful night, during their search, they make an astonishing discovery—an abandoned governmental lab filled with preserved evidence of a global climate restoration effort that had been sabotaged decades earlier by the very corporation they serve. Just as they secure the device, their presence sets off an alarm, leading to a sweep by the Umbrella's notorious enforcers. Aaliyah must decide whether they risk capture to reveal the truth or retreat to safety.

In a heart-pounding escape sequence, they narrowly evade capture. However, the tension within the group escalates; Kael questions Aaliyah’s conviction after witnessing the brutality of the enforcers. Jonah proposes an immediate public reveal, but Minoo urges caution, fearful of their growing notoriety. The race against time reaches its peak as they regroup at a safe house, consolidating evidence. Ultimately, they decide to forge ahead, using Minoo’s hacking skills to broadcast their findings across the city's network under the veil of anonymity. As the information flows, the walls of the Umbrella begin to crumble under the weight of public outrage over the corporate manipulations that led to their isolation.

Once the truth surfaces, chaos erupts within the Umbrella. Citizens, fueled by indignation over their exploitation, band together, and armed resistance forms. Aaliyah, Kael, Minoo, and Jonah find themselves not just as truth-bearers but as unintentional leaders in a movement aimed to dismantle the oppressive structures that they've come to know. With their lives transformed forever, they face a world no longer defined by protective barriers. In the wake of revolution, Aaliyah envisions new societies rising, where the natural world and humanity reconcile, while Kael contemplates a future without enforced order. Minoo vows to use his skills for creation rather than theft, and Jonah begins drafting a narrative that will immortalize their struggle, convinced that real change has only just begun. The Umbrella that once shielded them now stands as a symbol of their collective fight for freedom and the right to coexist with the world outside.
