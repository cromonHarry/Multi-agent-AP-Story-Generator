In the year 2045, dental care has undergone a revolutionary transformation thanks to advancements in biotechnology and artificial intelligence. The common dentist has evolved into a hybrid role, with specialists known as "Dentacists" integrating dental care with biogenetics. Until now, glad-gloved humans had ruled over clinics, but robotic assistants called “Dentibots” are now the main practitioners, carrying out routine procedures with unparalleled precision. Livia Kane, a young and ambitious Dentacist, operates in the bustling metropolis of Neo-Atlanta, where dental tourism has become a booming industry. Dealing daily with clients who often undergo aesthetic modifications, she is caught between her desire for clinical excellence and the pressure from her boss, Dr. Anton Reyes, a charismatic yet demanding leader whose only goal is profit, often at the expense of patient care. Marla, Livia’s childhood friend, now a patient, suffers from untreated dental fear, making Livia question the ethical implications of the fast-paced dental world.

As Livia works on enhancing her bio-engineering methods to reduce pain perception during procedures, she discovers a program named "Memoria," an experimental neural interface that can erase traumatic dental experiences from a patient’s mind. Flashing advertisements promise a stress-free dental experience, but Livia isn’t fully convinced of its safety and integrity. When she decides to volunteer for the program in a bid to overcome her insecurities regarding her own reconstruction, she unwittingly ignites a cascade of unforeseen events. Marla, seeking to combat her own phobias, sees Livia's success and embraces the treatment, but the algorithm malfunctions, leading Marla to inadvertently forget the trauma while creating disturbing gaps in her memory.

With patients affected and Marla in distress, the clinic faces an uproar as individuals' memories begin becoming intermingled—one patient’s fear contorting with another’s traumas. The semblance of professionalism is threatened, and paranoia begins to spread among clients already disillusioned by the idea of giving up control of their minds to a droid-enhanced dentist. Dr. Reyes, desperate to maintain his clinic's reputation, pressures Livia to publicly endorse the malfunctioning program, all while the Dentibots take on erratic behaviors, merging diagnostic and treatment data freakishly. Distrust escalates, leading to a trickle of dissatisfaction that becomes a torrent as negative reviews flood into the clinic’s system.

In a tense confrontation, Livia retaliates against Dr. Reyes’s motives to commercialize the Dentabots for astonishing profits over ethical groundbreaking medical practices. She catches the connection between the anomaly in “Memoria” and the Dentibots, leading her to formulate a plan that not only protects her patients but aims at dismantling the corporate strategy behind the technology. With the help of Marla, who struggles to reveal the fears encapsulated within her erased memories, they confront the tragic consequences of what should have been a boost of technology intertwining humanity and trade. It becomes a race against time to recall the Dentabot protocol and reverse its overwhelming effects before irreversible trauma looms for patients.

Ultimately, Livia fights for the recovery of memories and experiences as her proclamation to re-establish dental ethics allows patients to take back control of their own health choices. Dr. Reyes’s fame shatters as whistleblower allegations reveal that when sadistic motivations intertwine with medical advancement, the ultimate price is the lives behind the lights. Livia, alongside her supporters, launches a grassroots movement called “True Dentistry,” advocating for consent, emotional safety, and superior technology through human influence. As memories slowly return, Marla begins to heal—a process that underscores the core tenet Livia holds: true healing of the teeth is only as effective as the healing of the mind. The world of dental care shifts toward revitalizing lost humanity, thus ensuring that the price of health never wears another’s face again.
