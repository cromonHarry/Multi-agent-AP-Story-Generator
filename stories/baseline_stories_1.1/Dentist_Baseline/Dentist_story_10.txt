In the year 2045, society has embraced a revolutionary approach to dental care, with clinics like NeuDentist dominating cityscapes. Instead of conventional procedures, patients choose to undergo full cognitive uploads where their dental issues are diagnosed and treated by an AI named Oron. The protagonist, Juno Tsai, is a recently graduated Bio-Dentist, trained in the blend of biotechnology and nanotechnology, who feels the interpersonal connection with patients is disappearing. Juno struggles with the idea of completely surrendering human touch to machines, especially as her childhood friend, Aria, a tech-savvy influencer, champions the new dental innovations. Meanwhile, patients like Roberto, a frequent visitor terrified of the dentist, embrace the futuristic approach with enthusiasm, seeing it as a liberation from traditional fear.

When Juno is charged with testing an experimental program that combines human insight with Oron's AI capabilities, she reluctantly accepts, seeing it as an opportunity to validate her concerns. Simultaneously, Aria hosts a live demonstration of the newest neuromodulator gadget at the NeuDentist clinic, claiming it will eliminate the need for traditional numbing agents during dental work. The atmosphere buzzes with anticipation, and media coverage amplifies the spectacle, drawing increasing attention to society’s health-tech embrace. To make matters intense, Juno discovers troubling reports of patients experiencing side effects and regressions from earlier treatments under Oron's watch. She debates whether to bring this to light amidst the fanfare and her own internal conflict of ensuring patient care while strengthening her technological skills.

The demonstration reaches its peak when a glitch occurs in the system, prompting severe reactions among the audience. Roberto, observing the uncanny detachment of the technology now glitching, has a panic attack reminiscent of his traumatic childhood dentist visits. Juno springs into action, combining her bio-dentist education with her newfound AI skills to guide Oron and save Roberto from a state of shock. The event erupts into chaos as patients and press alike reel from the dilemma. In this moment of uncertainty, Juno realizes she can leverage her talents to create a middle ground—enhancing the AI's learning capabilities while also ensuring human input remains crucial.

In the aftermath, Juno fulfills her vision, proposing a groundbreaking plan that bridges the relationship between patients and machines. With security in place and her redesigned program implemented, she advocates for emotional intelligence in patient care to be embedded into Oron. Patients like Roberto grow to trust the coexistence of AI and human interaction, leading to an unexpected healthcare change blended with compassion. Aria, initially tuned to the glamor of adornments, amplifies Juno’s mission through her platform, promoting an empathetic approach to the dental revolution. The relationship among the four friends shifts as they prioritize values surrounding trust and vulnerability in the face of advanced technology.

Ultimately, the NeuDentist clinic emerges as a sanctuary of balance between humanity's emotional needs and cutting-edge advancements. Juno's vision gains traction, inspiring a new generation of dentists who embrace innovations while reaffirming their commitment to patients' care through human connection. Aria rekindles their friendship by capturing this shift during her live broadcasts, reshaping public perception of dental treatment as a collaborative journey rather than an alienating experience. Juno, alongside her friends and newfound allies from the uprooted chaos, initiates a series of seminars exploring the future of dentistry where technology and empathy coexist harmoniously, marking a new era in dental care that embraces both science and sentiment.
