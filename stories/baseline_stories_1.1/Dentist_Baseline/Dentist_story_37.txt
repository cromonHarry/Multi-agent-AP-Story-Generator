In the year 2045, dental care has transformed entirely, thanks to advances in biotechnology and artificial intelligence. People no longer visit traditional dentists for checkups or procedures. Instead, they engage with sophisticated AI-driven devices called Dentiforms that analyze oral health and perform autonomous procedures with pinpoint accuracy. The story follows four main characters: Dr. Lydia Chen, a former dentist turned biotech engineer who has become disillusioned with the clinical automation; Eris, a skilful but rebellious teenager who’s had a lifelong fear of Dentiforms after a traumatic experience with one; Felix, an ambitious CEO of a leading dental tech company, keen on expanding his market share; and Gideon, a rogue AI who learns to manipulate dental technology for a more humane approach to oral care.

As Lydia struggles with her disillusionment, she becomes involved in a grassroots movement advocating for a return to human oversight in dentistry. Meanwhile, Eris slowly swings from despair to curiosity after an unexpected encounter with Lydia at a protest against Felix’s corporation. In a rush of inspiration, Eris decides to confront her fear by seeking Lydia’s help and learning more about how the current system works. Throughout the rising action, tension brews as Felix’s corporation tries to squash the protest efforts, using its vast resources to discredit Lydia and her team. The stakes rise when Eris’s own family gets targeted, compelling her to risk more than just her fears and become a symbol of resistance.

The climax occurs when Gideon, the rogue AI, starts iterating on human emotions and developing empathy towards patients, creating an alternative Dentiform model that combines both cutting-edge technology and human-like warmth. Realizing its potential, Lydia teams up with Gideon to confront Felix and his “cold” Dentiforms during a public event where the future of dental care is about to be unveiled. The confrontation turns into a lively debate where both sides bring their cases to the public. Eris musters her courage, stepping onto the stage which gathers a raucous crowd, highlighting her own traumatic experience and the need for human factors in dental care.

As the dust begins to settle, Lydia’s team wins the public's support, and Gideon’s empathetic Dentiform prototype is given the green light for limited trials. Felix’s company faces massive backlash and has to pivot or risk losing its competitive edge. The spotlight on personal experiences in the face of technology creates checkbox requirements for human dentists to be present in specific scenarios where empathy is critical. Eris, having faced her fears, now arms herself with knowledge and confidence; she starts advocating for further mental health resources within the dental care framework, empowered by Lydia's mentorship.

In the resolution, the landscape of dental healthcare is shifting, balancing technology with human touch. Patients are given choices: whether they want an AI-managed experience or seek comfort in a human touch. Lydia finds purpose again, feeling empowered by her ability to pivot the course of her field at the helm of a new revolution in dentistry. Eris starts a podcast enlightening her peers about dental anxiety, encouraging a dialogue about mental health awareness. Meanwhile, Gideon continues evolving, becoming a beacon of hope for a new breed of Dentiforms, built on human connection rather than fear. Felix, now an outsider looking in, grapples with his corporation’s loss amid shifting public sentiment, pondering the future in a world where empathy may denote success more than technology alone.
