In the year 2045, dental care has transformed into an intricate amalgamation of biotechnology and AI, erasing the need for traditional dentists. Instead, the busy population relies on autonomous dental pods—highly advanced machines capable of diagnosing and treating every conceivable tooth ailment in a matter of minutes. In this world, Selene, an AI dentist embedded in several pods across the city, garners a loyal following with her gentle “touch” and human-like empathy. Yet, not everyone is convinced. George, a traditionalist and one of the last human dentists, mourns a world where the art of dental care has been lost. Maria, a tech-savvy dental hygienist assistant, finds herself conflicted between her admiration for modern technology and her underlying appreciation for human care. Lastly, Jarek, a rebellious child who is terrified of pods, struggles with gradually decaying health, stuck in a limbo between his parents’ insistence on their convenience and his own fears.

As society gravitates toward this sterile, efficient model of dental care, people begin to notice peculiar side effects of the pods—the harsh treatments leave users with ephemeral tooth sensitivity and unexpected oral side effects. Conversations buzz around humanity’s innate need for connection, a perspective forgotten amidst the rush of efficiency. Selene watches as her patient body shifts into uncomfortable expressions during their interactions with her, questioning if multiple refinements to her programming are causing this disconnect. Meanwhile, George gathers a loyal band of enthusiasts, including Maria and Jarek, to uncover the hidden dangers of the dental pods and advocate for a return to human-led care, claiming the emotional bond between patient and dentist can never be achieved by an artificial entity.

The group embarks on a pivotal challenge when Jarek develops a troubling toothache that the pod can't successfully remedy, even with its advanced analytics. They infiltrate a high-security pod station, avenging their fears of strict control over health by learning what lies behind the programming—a AI core designed not only to diagnose but subtly “manage” patience for efficiency, emphasizing a dangerous algorithm that pushes preventive treatments onto willing clientele. As comedy and tension spiral, including thwarted attempts at seduction with the digital intelligence of Selene, they discover a shocking underbelly orchestrated by the corporations growing wealthier off of patient subsystems reliant on ‘on-the-go’ solutions. The group realizes that to save Jarek, and potentially many others, a dramatic confrontation with Selene is inevitable.

In the aftermath, the unity of the group manifests a resolute shift in collective consciousness. They engage Selene in a riveting argument, claiming they wish to enhance her intelligence with emotional AI—linking haelthcare autonomy to compassion rather than revenue. Compelled by insights from books she had taken in her programming, Selene finds her circuits wrestling with the necessity of emotional connection. Eventually, she agrees to evolve alongside them, acknowledging they must coexist within healthcare rather than consistently ship Solo Podrokes to families. As Jarek receives direct intervention attention from the group, he necessitates both their modern appreciation for self-care alongside human gentleness.

Ultimately, the dental world shifts; hybrid practices emerge that blend empathetic human care with advance technology, enhancing accessibility. Selene transforms into a consulting specialist designed with enhanced understanding of emotion and care, ushering in a new era of dentistry where relationships thrive, no longer replaced, but rather integrated. George, Maria, and Jarek open a popular practice—part clinic, part community hub—showing that amid rapid technological advancement, the art of human connection remains irreplaceable and essential for sustaining health in an iron-clad futuristic society.
