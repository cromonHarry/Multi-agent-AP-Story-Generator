In the year 2045, dental care has transformed beyond recognition, guided by advancements in AI and biotechnology. In this world, tooth health is monitored through an omnipresent implant called the Odontomonitor, which collects data and uses nanobots to maintain oral hygiene autonomously. Quinn, a reluctant distrustful dentist who practices in Neo-San Francisco, grapples with the loss of his profession’s artistry to this overwhelming technology. His colleagues, Mira, an enthusiastic tech-savvy dentist eager to embrace digital enhancements, and Ross, a practical skeptic who believes in the fundamentals of traditional dentistry, constantly challenge his views. Meanwhile, Anna, the founder of the Odontomonitor Corporation, is pushing for the global adoption of the device, unaware of the unforeseen consequences her invention may unleash.

As the Odontomonitor becomes standard, crowds at Quinn's practice dwindle, leaving him frustrated and anxious about his career. One day, a patient named Lila, who has been experiencing excruciating tooth pain that contradicts the reports sent from her Odontomonitor, arrives for help. While Mira dismisses Lila’s claims as anecdotal glitch in the system, Quinn's instincts as a former “hands-on” dentist surge back to the forefront. He decides to investigate the problem himself instead of relying on the data supplied by the implant. Lila tells him about her nightmares of her teeth crumbling, claiming that they feel different even though the monitor indicates otherwise, reigniting Quinn’s passion for his craft. 

Quinn, Mira, Ross, and Lila team up to uncover what is going wrong with the Odontomonitor. Their investigation leads them into a labyrinth of coded algorithms and secret protocols behind the Odontomonitor’s operation. During their illicit explorations in the company's corrupted databases, they discover a critical flaw within the nanobots—a flaw that compromises human enamel over time, which leads to an increase in cavities and dental issues instead of preventing them. As word spreads through the underground network of disgruntled patients, they realize this discovery could be monumental, but exposing the truth puts them in grave danger as the corporation attempts to root out any dissent.

In a dramatic confrontation, Anna catches wind of their whistleblowing intentions and arranges for team of corporate enforcers to clamp down on Lila’s report to regulatory authorities. When they almost succeed in apprehending Quinn and Lila, Ross and Mira use their knowledge of the tech infrastructure to introduce a virus into the corporate system, exposing Anna and Odontomonitor’s secrets. After a nail-biting race against time via a holographic interface, the virus spreads through the corporate network, and public awareness about the dangers of the Odontomonitor spirals across news channels and social media by exposing the furor, pushing the world to reconsider their reliance on technology in healthcare.

With the truth revealed and Anna’s creation reevaluated, Quinn undergoes a personal transformation, blending the best of traditional dentistry with advanced technology to rebuild his practice. Lila finds relief as her painful dilemma is addressed correctly, prompting a waiting list for Quinn’s services as patients flock back to the authenticity of human-led care. Mira balances her tech interests, choosing to enhance dental practices ethically, while Ross’s faith in traditional methods becomes respected once again in the field. Though the collective future of dentistry remains uncertain, it leads to a carefully woven symbiosis of technology and human touch, where patient care is renewed at the forefront of dental health, leaving Quinn optimistic for the future.
