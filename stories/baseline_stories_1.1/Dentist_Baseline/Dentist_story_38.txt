In the year 2045, dental care has advanced into the realm of neuro-diagnostics and bioengineering, where traditional dentists have transformed into specialists known as "Biocudists." Dr. Lira Tanaka, a pioneering Biocudist, runs an innovative clinic that combines AI diagnostic tools with nanotechnological repairs to prevent and treat dental issues at the molecular level. Alongside Lira is her assistant, Dan, a charming but somewhat hapless tech wizard who provides unwavering support while dealing with his own lingering cavities, which he refuses to address. Their clinic attracts a diverse clientele, including Moxy, a quirky artist whose gouache-themed smile gallery has become a local sensation, and Brad, a disgruntled patient resistant to dental interventions after a traumatic experience as a child.

As the demand for advanced dental work rises, the clinic begins to receive attention from a shadowy corporation known as Molarscape, eager to acquire Lira’s innovation for profit. Lira grapples with this prospect, torn between the traditional values of patient care and the implications of surrendering her groundbreaking treatments to corporate exploitation. Moxy, who has developed a friendship with Lira, learns of the looming acquisition and encourages her to maintain the integrity of her practice. Meanwhile, Dan unwittingly becomes embroiled in the corporate machinations, discovering that they intend to use Lira's technology to control public perceptions of dental health, making invasive treatments mandatory rather than optional.

Amid growing tension, Dan's procrastination regarding his cavities leads to complications that require immediate Biocudist intervention. A miscommunication with Molarscape turns into a full-blown crisis when they attempt to abduct Dan for experimentation, believing he holds the key to a more aggressive form of bio-engineered enhancement. Lira and Moxy must work together to stage a rescue, outsmarting a team of corporate agents using Lira's tech and Moxy’s creative thinking. In the midst of the chaos, Lira stands up for her ethical beliefs, declaring that dental health should be a choice governed by individual rights rather than profit-driven agendas.

As they confront Molarscape in a dramatic showdown, Lira publicly accusations the corporation of prioritizing profit over public health. With the help of a hactivist group that Dan unintentionally connected with through their online forums, they expose the corporation’s plans, leading to public outrage and a significant backlash against Molarscape. The clinic’s reputation is fortified, seen not only as a healthcare provider but also as a bastion for patient rights. This tumultuous event lands Lira, Dan, and Moxy a spot in the national spotlight, making them champions for a healthier, more ethical future in dental care.

In the aftermath, Lira redefines her practice, ensuring that patient autonomy remains at the forefront of her work. Dan, inspired by the chaos and the newfound purpose, decides to bravely address his dental issues, embarking on a humorous self-improvement journey. Moxy finds her inspiration reignited and begins painting a series depicting the importance of dental health, contributing to community wellness. Through challenges, friendships blossom, and the trio realizes that not only has their world changed, but they themselves have emerged stronger, advocating for the future of healthcare that prioritizes compassion over commerce.
