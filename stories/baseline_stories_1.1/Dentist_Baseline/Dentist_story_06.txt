In the near future, dental care has transcended traditional practices, embracing advanced technology and genetic engineering. The world is filled with Neural Dentists, professionals who connect their minds with patients to provide instant dental diagnosis and treatment via a neural interface. In this society, where perfect smiles are considered a status symbol, maintaining one’s oral health is incredibly competitive. Our protagonist, Juno, a young Neural Dentist apprentice with a troubled past, has aspirations of becoming the best in her field. She works under Dr. Marco Finch, a well-respected figure known for his remarkable techniques and strict methods. Adding complexity to her world are Lila, her childhood friend, and supportive partner who struggles with dental anxieties, and Soren, a wealthy client marked by his flawless, celebrity-like smile but hiding secrets that could unravel their community’s notion of perfection.

As Juno delves deeper into her training, she faces a crisis when Lila comes in for a routine procedure. Due to the invasive nature of neural links, Lila’s anxiety amplifies, causing her to experience a panic attack. Juno discovers that there’s a significant risk of memory erasure in hyperventilating patients linked to the neural interface. After saving Lila within the mishap, Juno starts questioning the ethics surrounding the revolutionary practices of the Neural Dentists. Meanwhile, rumor spreads in their high-society circles about Soren's smile not being achieved naturally, leading Juno to investigate the darker side of enhanced oral aesthetics—artificial smiles that could be made and manipulated through illegal tech advancements.

The tension escalates when Soren, fearing exposure from a rival dental studio, approaches Juno for assistance in deleting neural records that could ruin him. Torn between her loyalty to her friend Lila and the demand of a powerful client, Juno grapples with the moral implications of manipulating patients’ memories. As she starts to bridge gaps in the underbelly of the dental industry, she uncovers a conspiracy where wealthy individuals have taken to swapping neural smiles among themselves, endangering true identity and authenticity in favor of curated perfection. In a climactic moment, Lila decides to confront Soren about his insincerity and challenges him to reveal the truth, catalyzing a standoff where they all have to choose between wealth and wisdom, truth and deception.

Following the confrontation, the truth about neural Dentistry permeates society. Juno decides to abandon her current practice under Dr. Finch, seeing the harm that has been caused by eliminating the natural essence of customers’ smiles. Armed with her newfound knowledge, she proposes a new way of approaching dental care that advocates for improved mental health support, naturally available aesthetic improvements, and encourages patients to love their authentic selves instead of forging artificial images. As Lila embraces her imperfections, suggesting vulnerability can be empowering, the community begins a slow but promising transformation focused on acceptance rather than superiority.

In the newly reformed dental world, Juno establishes her own practice that combines traditional dental care with mental health support, creating a safe space for her clients. She forges new relationships, emphasizes the importance of genuine connections, and helps spread awareness of ethical practices within the industry. Lila has transformed into a confident ambassador of self-love, speaking about the importance of maintaining mental health alongside dental health. Dr. Finch, seeing the potential in Juno's new methods, offers to partner with her, thus redeeming his once more superficial approach. Together, they herald the dawn of an era where dentists strive not just for aesthetic perfection, but for genuine well-being, proving that true beauty—dental or otherwise—comes from embracing one’s true self.
