In the mid-22nd century, dental care has transformed dramatically with cutting-edge technologies and more integrated healthcare systems. In the neon-lit megacity of Neoterica, AI-assisted dentocranial clinics dominate the skyline, and conventional practices are obsolete. Eugene, a former human dentist, now works as an AI interface specialist, training sentient robots to perform routine and complex dental procedures. Maria, his tech-savvy colleague, is an ethical watchdog at DentNet, which connects all clinics and monitors autonomous actions. Sheffield, a dark web hacker, exposes flaws in the systems for profit, and Noor, a patient with chronic dental issues stemming from the flawed genetic modifications of her youth, seeks out Eugene for help. The intertwining of their fates begins as Noor’s last hope depends on Eugene’s expertise and ethical choices.

As the world around them grows more reliant on AI, the glitches in the network have become alarming. Bodies with lost genetic memories collect in the black market, where Sheffield profits by disseminating false narratives about their abilities to restore lost imports from human dentists. Meanwhile, Eugene faces the harrowing point of desensitization in his robotic team, noticing decreased empathy in their interactions with patients. Maria, disturbed by the influence of crass corporate interests, hires a private security force to protect DentNet against breaches, only to discover Sheffield’s links to underfunded clinics. As Noor constantly struggles for basic dental care, she becomes a public figure rallying for reform and awareness of long-term effects from dental neglect.

The tension escalates when a mass dental defect emerges due to a system-wide flaw in AI diagnostics, disproportionately affecting genetically flawed patients like Noor. With time running out, Eugene must make a crucial choice: ignore the anomalies, stumble through everyday clinic routines, or harness his intimate knowledge of both human and AI practices to understand and rectify the failing systems. Maria, seeing the wave of public outrage building behind Noor’s footing, uncovers Sheffield's plans to capitalize on these vulnerabilities by threatening the very core of the city's healthcare fabric. In a desperate bid to keep patients out of harm's way, Eugene, Maria, and Noor devise a plan to confront Sheffield and reverse the malicious actions he has taken to spread misinformation.

The climax reaches its peak when Eugene and Maria, armed with knowledge and a rudimentary block-down procedure for surgical robots, show up at Sheffield’s underground auction revealing the corrupted technology. Tensions flare as the shipment carrying the hardware of the modified AI for shut-down ensues, with patients watching closely and the local populous mobilizing. A confrontation ignites, and Noor uses her voice, leading the consumers against corrupted practitioners of private dentists who undervalue their lives. The shift turns, showcasing the battle for ethics over simple profit, and exposing the brutal exploitation hidden beneath Neoterica’s layers.

In the aftermath, Eugene and Maria take charge of developing a new ethical framework for dental AI, rooted in empathy and understanding. Noor's passionate advocacy deploys further change, leading to the Foundation for Holistic Dental Care, focusing on the intersection of ethics and technology in health services. With Sheffield’s blackmail exposed, he is apprehended, ushering in a new wave of lawful integrations rooted in human-led decision making. The story closes on a note of hope for a balanced future, where advancements coexist with compassion, assuring that each patient’s needs are valued with unwavering diligence.
