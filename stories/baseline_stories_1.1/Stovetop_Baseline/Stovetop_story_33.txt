In the year 2042, cooking has transcended from simple stovetops to advanced holographic culinary systems known as SynthStoves, which harness molecular gastronomy and artificial intelligence. It is a common sight to see families gathered around their sleek, vertical SynthStoves—a fusion of 3D printer and traditional oven—projecting colorful holograms of dishes while vocalizing users' preferences, dietary restrictions, and mood. In this world, a single mother, Aria, juggles her high-pressure job in data analytics while trying to bond with her two children, Leo and Mira. They represent the new generation that relies heavily on technology for convenience rather than culinary skills. The family struggles with the lack of authentic cooking experiences, often opting for automated meal solutions. Their neighbor, Nova, an aspiring chef and avid proponent of traditional cooking, believes that genuine culinary art is a vital form of communication that fosters connections.

One day, after a frustrating experience with a malfunctioning SynthStove, Aria comes home to find Leo and Mira engrossed in another digital cooking competition that diminishes real interactions. Annoyed and longing for connection, Aria enlists Nova’s help to organize a "Stovetop Revival," an experimental event that encourages families to return to the fundamentals of cooking using portable, retro stovetops while experimenting with their recipes. The community’s reaction is mixed; some see it as a step back into a tedious past, while others are intrigued. Together, the four of them challenge their reliance on technology and decide to confront their culinary fears each week, exploring old recipes from before the SynthStove era. The revival draws various participants, igniting a household feud between tech enthusiasts and traditionalists.

As the weeks of the Stovetop Revival progress, hidden tensions evolve. Leo begins to flourish in this environment, mastering delightful local dishes, creating a bridge between him and Mira, who still struggles to celebrate the messiness of cooking without tech's guidance. Conflicting interpretations of what it means to cook arise, especially when Nova’s passion for cuisine clashes with Aria’s need for efficiency, leading to arguments about priorities and identity. The climax builds during the finale of the revival, a potluck where families showcase their best dishes. Unbeknownst to everyone, Nova’s experimental dish—an elaborate but poorly-executed recipe sourced from an ancient culinary book—draws uproar, leading to a spirited debate between cooks of tradition and advocates of convenience.

The post-revival aftermath sees friendships put to the test as Aria confronts her inability to balance work, cooking, and family bonding. Leo and Mira are stuck between the allure of SynthStoves and the richness of traditional cooking. Finally, at a reflective dinner with Mari and Nova, Aria experiences both sides of the conflict firsthand; cheerful discussions intertwine with acknowledgment of complexity in their family’s cooking narrative. Encouraged by Leo’s newfound enthusiasm and Mira’s innocent culinary mistakes, she proposes a mix between the two worlds—a unique SynthStove feature that blends recipes from the family’s cooking journey, turning failures into fun learning moments, creating something that uses cutting-edge technology while honoring the past. 

In the end, the family evolves, embracing technology without losing their connection to culinary heritage. The final meal involves a community gathering that dimly hints at next generations blending cooking traditions with modern advances. The family understands that the essence of gathering around a stovetop—be it retro or futuristic—remains rooted in the stories shared and the love grown in their unique culinary experience. Aria and her children realize that the oscillation between the past and the future is not about rejecting one for the other but rather achieving harmony, and their new hybrid family meal becomes a symbol of their journey, underscoring that the true ingredient of cooking is the bond that savory meals create.
