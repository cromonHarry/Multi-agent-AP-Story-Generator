In the year 2045, society has become heavily reliant on technology for every aspect of life, including rest. Innovations have led to a world where sleep is no longer a necessity but rather a carefully curated experience. People schedule “Bedtime” through an app called Somniverse, which customizes the duration and quality of rest. Neural implants called SleepSync allow for collective dream experiences, transforming night into a vivid exploration of imagination. In this world, four friends—Aria, a researcher for Somniverse; Jax, a struggling artist; Marcus, a tech engineer; and Lola, an insomniac medic—navigate the shifts in sleep culture, grappling with the emotional toll these advancements take on their relationships and mental health.

As Bedtime becomes a competitive social norm, Aria finds herself dealing with the pressures of her job, constantly pushing users toward perfect sleep. Meanwhile, Jax feels increasingly frustrated as his artistic inspiration fades; he realizes that the collective dreams often overwrite his own creative visions. Marcus, enthusiastic about technology, discovers a flaw in the SleepSync system, which inadvertently suppresses deep emotional connections by standardizing dreams. All the while, Lola remains an outcast in this society; her insomnia means she is often plagued by the chaotic remnants of nightmares, feeling more like an observer in the lives of her friends, prompting her to voice her concerns about the human disconnect.

During a milestone event promoting the latest SleepSync technology, Marcus decides to experiment with a beta version of the app that allows users to experience dreams intertwined with the concept of true emotional connection. However, when the launch goes awry, a glitch traps the four friends within their own projected dreamscapes. Each friend confronts their deepest fears and unfulfilled desires: Aria faces the emptiness of external validation, Jax confronts the pressure to conform artistically, Marcus grapples with the loneliness that technology creates, and Lola navigates her mental health struggles. The friends must work together to escape the dream trap before they lose their identities forever.

In the aftermath of the glitch, the friends awaken to a world where their relationships have been irrevocably changed. Conversations become a source of exploration rather than just routine greetings. Aria begins to question whether the perfect sleep is worth sacrificing the human connection she’s come to cherish. Jax finds a renewed sense of purpose in embracing spontaneity within his art, inspired by his chaotic dream interactions. Marcus decides to use his skills to adapt the SleepSync technology to encourage deeper emotional engagement rather than suppress it. Lola, motivated by her experiences in the dream world, opens a monthly gathering for people struggling with insomnia to share their stories and feelings, aiming to reconnect those feeling isolated.

In the end, the societal perception of Bedtime shifts dramatically. The app now promotes not just sleep as a commodity, but sleep as an experience that values genuine emotional bonds over superficial validation. The friends unite, realizing that while technology can enhance life, the essence of being human lies in vulnerability and connection. As they set new foundations for the evening rituals of their friendships, they learn to embrace the messiness of life, choosing to forgo the engineered perfection of the Somniverse for genuine aesthetic chaos—a truly shared Bedtime experience.
