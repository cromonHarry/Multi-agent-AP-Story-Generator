In the year 2042, "Bedtime" has transcended its simple, mundane origins. Thanks to advanced technology and changing societal norms, sleep is no longer seen as a mere necessity but a customizable experience enhanced by immersive dream worlds. The characters — Zane, a sleep engineer; Mia, an ambitious journalist; Eli, Zane’s young son; and Ruth, Mia’s aging grandmother who clings to the nostalgia of the past — navigate this altered reality. Zane works for the leading firm, SleepSphere, programming tailored dreams via neural interfaces called Dreamcasters. Mia, on a quest to critique the impact of SleepSphere on society, becomes intrigued by Zane’s innovations, further complicated by her grandmother's fading memories, eclipsed by synthetic experiences that seem to replace real life.

As Mia begins investigating the effects of Dreamcasters on the population, she interviews Zane. He reveals that the company’s latest product, DreamScape 2.0, allows a user to explore worlds built from their memories, creating hyper-realistic simulations that can replace actual experiences. Meanwhile, Eli struggles to connect with his father, as Zane’s obsession with his work leaves little room for family. The boy finds solace in the vintage bedtime stories his grandmother shares, the warmth of old traditions contrasting sharply with the cutting-edge sleep environments. Mia starts to see potential dangers in the technology, such as addiction to dream experiences and the erasure of genuine emotions and memories. 

During a tech expo where SleepSphere unveils DreamScape 2.0, Mia discovers Eli trying to dismantle a Dreamcaster to save his father from addiction, reinforcing Mia's suspicions. As Zane gives a presentation, Eli’s rebellious actions almost draw the attention of security. While trying to defend her son, she confronts Zane about their family’s disintegration, leading to an emotional clash on staged scrutiny. Meanwhile, Ruth suffers from a breakdown when she realizes her cherished memories are influenced by the market’s designs, and she’s unsure if she’s moving toward nostalgia or memory enslavement. The tension builds as realistic and synthetic dreams collide at the event.

The climax reaches its peak when Eli, in a moment of desperation, accesses DreamScape and finds himself trapped in an ever-evolving world that feeds off his fears. Mia plunges into the Dreamcaster, guided by instinct and desperation to save him. Zane reluctantly follows, realizing that family and love should outweigh the allure of technology. Together, they navigate through Eli’s emotional labyrinth, confronting shared memories and personal fears, forcing Zane to confront his obsession and Mia to confront the harsh truths of her investigation.

As they emerge from the depths of the Dreamscape, the experience bonds them in a new understanding of the importance of genuine connection and meaningful discourse. Zane vows to prioritize his family and redesign Dreamcasters with safeguards to prevent emotional detachment. Mia decides to write an exposé that both critiques the technology and highlights the importance of real experiences. Ruth, inspired by the ordeal, begins illustrating stories of the past, claiming her place as keeper of history in an age that threatens to overlook it. Together, they forge a new path, balancing innovation with tradition, reminding humanity that true rest comes not just through sleep but in shared connections and cherished moments.
