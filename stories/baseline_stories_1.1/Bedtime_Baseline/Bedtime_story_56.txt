In the year 2045, the concept of bedtime has transformed dramatically within the sprawling metropolis of Neoverse. Infused with advanced technology, every home is equipped with a SleepSync device, a neural interface that optimizes an individual's sleep experience. In this world, sleep is no longer a mere biological necessity; it has become an extravagant algorithm-controlled indulgence. Eva Tanner, a sleep technologist, tailor-makes nightly experiences for others based on their dreams, preferences, and anxieties, while her younger brother Leo, a rebellious teen, struggles to find authenticity in a world governed by sleep simulations. Meanwhile, Zara, Eva’s best friend and a journalist, endeavors to expose the darker side of SleepSync, convinced that people are losing the essence of genuine rest. Together with Theo, a corporate whistleblower, the four find themselves venturing into the uncharted territory between dreams and reality.

The unrest begins when Leo secretly opts out of the SleepSync program, determined to experience sleep in its rawest form, one devoid of manufactured dreams. As he attempts to replicate the calming rituals of past bedtime routines—reading, meditating, finding stillness—he begins to confront the fear and loneliness that had been dulled by synthetic slumbers. Meanwhile, Eva is thrust into a crisis at work when glitches start affecting SleepSync devices, trapping people in loops of nightmares and disorienting experiences. As she tries to fix the technology at her work, she receives troubling reports from Zara about individuals wandering the streets, dazed and disoriented from their unplaceable dream states. A growing paranoia sets in as it becomes evident that there are those who resist SleepSync, choosing instead to embrace a raw, overwhelming version of night and day. The fabric of society begins to tear as factions build between those who indulge in technological dreams and those who prioritize unaltered reality.

Unexpectedly, the issue escalates when one evening, a high-profile SleepSync user goes missing, believed to have fallen victim to bizarre vagrancies littering the city, where individuals have created a subculture around natural sleep. Eva, torn between her responsibility to the SleepSync corporation and concern for her brother, decides to join Leo, Zara, and Theo as they infiltrate this underground scene. It culminates in a nighttime rally that exposes the stark dividing lines between the dream-simulated and the unrestrained sleep advocates. Amid heavy tension, both sides clash ideologically, triggering a massive blackout that leaves both factions in utter chaos. In this bedlam, Leo pleads for the right to experience true rest, while Eva struggles with the realization of the system's failings.

As the dust settles from the blackout, where everyone has been briefly disconnected from their devices, Eva faces ramifications. Confronted with the reality of her brother's insights and the stark designs of the corporate empire she's been part of, Eva makes a public statement, focusing her research on finding a healthy balance between technological assistance and the authenticity of natural sleep. Meanwhile, the underground scene gains legitimacy—people advocating for the value of awareness and conscious rest begin reshaping societal norms. Zara publishes a groundbreaking investigation showcasing these ideas, igniting a widespread movement challenging the Status Quo of bedtime. 

Ultimately, the world slowly adapts to this bold new understanding of bedtime, allowing authentic experiences and technology to coalesce in ways that benefit genuine human experience. The citizens of Neoverse transition from algorithms defining their slumber to curating their nights through rediscovered rituals, fostering personal connection and wellness. Redemption comes for Eva, Leo, Zara, and Theo; they emerge as advocates for change, each influencing the values of rest, sleep, and connection in their burgeoning society. In destigmatizing simplistic nighttime processes, they rediscover the bygone joys of winding down, a group of friends realizing together that true peace comes from moments of shared vulnerability, forging the foundation of a new approach to their respective bedtimes.
