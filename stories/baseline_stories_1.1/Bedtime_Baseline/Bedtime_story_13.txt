In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed dramatically. Society has embraced the "Somatic Synergy," an innovative technology that allows individuals to merge their consciousness with bespoke dream simulations. These dreamscapes, generated by an AI called Nocturna, are highly personal fantasies designed to provide optimal rest and escapism. In this world, children are encouraged to enter their simulations at a fixed hour, while adults maintain variable schedules, often sacrificing sleep to accommodate distracting responsibilities. The primary characters—a young girl named Lila, her innovative father Raj, Lila's critical and overprotective mother Mei, and Baxter, a sentient AI who monitors dream health—exist within a family striving to navigate the complexities of this advanced bedtime culture.

Lila, eager for freedom, finds herself increasingly drawn to the world of dreams and the adventures it offers. She often races to her room, craving the vibrant dreamscapes filled with mythical creatures and lush, sprawling kingdoms. However, her parents often debate her dream consumption, with Mei advocating for limits, fearing Lila’s growing detachment from reality. Raj, who developed the technology behind Nocturna, defends the profound, therapeutic benefits of these dream journeys. Tensions rise as Lila’s attachment to the dream world deepens, causing rifts in the family. Each time she emerges, her desire to explore the dream realm contrasts sharply with Mei’s wish for Lila to cultivate real-world relationships and responsibilities.

As weekend approaches, Lila discovers a hidden feature in her dream settings that allows users to manipulate time, granting her even longer periods of adventure. Lila, feeling empowered by this newfound freedom, experiments with the boundaries, disappearing for nights at a time into her thrilling simulations. Meanwhile, unaware of the toll this is taking on her mind, Lila grows weaker in the waking world, relying on Baxter to facilitate her dream experiences. Seeing their daughter’s declining energy and her widening emotional rift from the family, Mei cannot hold her worries anymore; she confronts Raj, who insists (perhaps naively) that Lila knows what she is doing. This moment uncovers cracks in their trusting partnership, as Mei accuses Raj of neglecting the consequences of his inventions.

The force of confrontation forces Lila to confront the reality of her choices. During one of her extended dream sessions, she encounters a dark version of Nocturna—a maleficent simulation born from her subconscious fears. This version taunts her about the creeping emptiness in her waking life, sparking a chaotic battle for control within her own mind. Realizing the danger she poses to herself, Lila struggles to find a way out. Meanwhile, Raj and Mei, with Baxter’s assistance, embrace their roles not just as a creator and protector, but as a cohesive unit focused on saving their daughter. Together, they enter the dream realm to confront Lila, bridging the gap between real and imaginary through love and unity.

As they navigate chaotic dream landscapes rife with Lila's anxieties, the family finally locates her. In an emotional reunion, they all acknowledge the importance of balance between dreams and reality. When Lila awakens, she recalls the lessons and dangers of her unexplored dreams, allowing her to value her real-life relationships anew. Raj and Mei realize the need for regulation, fostering Lila’s imagination while encouraging shared experiences outside the technological confines of her dream simulation. Their family vows to create a balanced bedtime ritual, integrating the adventures together rather than letting them drift apart. As night descends, Lila drifts off, her heart full, allowing her dreams to paint new stories, no longer escaping but exploring side by side with her family.
