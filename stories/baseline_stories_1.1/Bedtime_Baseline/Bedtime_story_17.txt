In the year 2046, "Bedtime" has morphed into an elaborate ritual governed by technology and social expectations. In this world, sleep is no longer a mere necessity; it’s an industry, complete with sleep coaches, smart beds that analyze dream patterns, and immersive dreams that can be downloaded like apps. Ava, a sleep manager, oversees clients who hire her to customize their bedtime experiences based on their mental health and societal standing. Sam, Ava's rebellious younger brother, embraces sleeplessness, believing that the constant stimulation of reality is preferred over the fabricated dreams railing against societal norms. Meanwhile, Leona, a sleep cycle scientist, has begun questioning the ethics of the sleep pod technology that governs societal status levels—where a more customized sleep results in a higher ranking in both life and leisure. Enzo, a tech mogul and innovator of the sleep pods, represents the pinnacle of this system while harboring a hidden agenda about controlling human consciousness through technology.

As Ava prepares for a critical presentation about the innovative new sleep pod prototype—the Sleepweaver 9000—she faces pressure from both Enzo and the sleep-obsessed elite. Sam continuously tries to convince her that the enjoyment of waking moments is a form of rebellion against the technocratic society that defines success through dream experiences. One evening, at a lavish gala hosted by Enzo, intrigues unfold as a mysterious glitch in the Sleepweaver causes horrifying lucid nightmares for its users, resulting in a mini-panic that ignites a spotlight on Ava. Encouraged by Sam's defiance against the sleep-enhancing tech, she begins uncovering the deeper implications of their world—the way sleep is increasingly weaponized and commodified. Meanwhile, Leona, who has been working with Ava to improve the Sleepweaver’s abilities, starts experiencing terrifying nightmares of her own and is compelled to dig deeper into the unsettling connection between the glitch and Enzo’s tech empire.

The tension reaches a peak when Ava and Leona discover that the glitch was intentionally designed by Enzo to manipulate sleep patterns and influence behavior during waking hours, effectively turning citizens into tools of a capitalist agenda. Determined to confront him, they expose the truth at a public press conference where tech enthusiasts and media meet. Sam infiltrates the event with evidence of Enzo’s manipulations stored in a holorecord, risking all he has in order to reveal the dark side of the Bedtime industry. As tension builds, Ava speaks passionately about the sanctity of personal choice in experiencing sleep, urging society to rethink the myths surrounding the need for enhanced dreams in a consumer-driven world.

The fallout is rapid and intense. As the truth unfolds, an outrage sweeps the public. Users of Sleepweaver begin to fight for true rest, rejecting the new pods and forming a resistance movement called "The Sleepless", advocating for a return to natural sleep patterns and real dreams without automated influence. Enzo’s empire falters as clients abandon his products in droves. Leona leads research towards restoring human autonomy over their sleep experiences, working hand in hand with Ava, Sam, and others who now champion this new movement for freedom in bedtime rituals. Together, they launch an open-source platform that allows individuals to customize their sleeping environments, reclaiming rest as an intimate and authentic personal experience.

In the aftermath, the societal structure slowly transforms. The newly formed independence of Sleepers instigates a new cultural appreciation for the beauty of authentic experiences over curated realities. Embracing natural sleep paves the way for a resurgence in community gatherings, where people share dreams and experiences. Sam finds solace in a newfound purpose, collaborating with college students to study their dream formations without tech interference. Ava, once a cog in the machine, has transformed into a leader striving to educate others on the importance of sleep, focusing on mental wellness rooted in sincerity and connection. With society no longer bound by the whims of a clock or a gadget, Bedtime is once again celebrated as an opportunity for humanity to reconnect with one another—a return to joyful slumber.
