In the year 2045, the concept of “Bedtime” has transformed into a highly advanced ritual, uniquely tailored to enhance cognitive functionality and emotional well-being. Society thrives on a schedule dictated by the neuro-enhancement industry, which has created a device called the SleepSync—a headband that syncs brainwaves to the optimal sleep cycle. Children aged five and up are equipped with these bands, including young Theo, who struggles with the constant pressures of a competitive education culture. His mother, Ashlyn, a dedicated education consultant, believes in the system wholeheartedly, while his father, Marc, a former tech designer turned skeptic, worries about its impact on their son. Theo's older sister, Mira, is a sleep health influencer who resists the SleepSync ideology, advocating for natural sleep patterns and creativity.

One night, after a particularly stressful day laden with exams and performance reviews, Ashlyn insists that Theo upgrade to the newest SleepSync model promising heightened creativity. As sleep approaches, Theo, overwhelmed and frightened by the pressure, discovers a hidden setting on his device that enables him to access alternate dream realities. During his first trial, he finds himself in a vivid dreamscape filled with fantastical worlds and eccentric characters. Here, he meets Leena, an enigmatic girl with the ability to manipulate her dream environment at will. However, their play is interrupted by the emergence of the Nightmares, lurking shadows that feed on the insecurities and fears of the dreamers, leading to a complex interplay between enhancing and suppressing libidinal energies.

As Theo becomes more intrigued by controlling his dreams, he neglects his awakening responsibilities, leading to a rift in his family. Mira discovers his secret and cautions him about the dangers of constantly escaping into dreams, mentioning a dark lore that states that frequent dreamers can lose the boundary between reality and fantasy. Tensions peak when Ashlyn notices Theo’s disappearance from social interactions and academic achievements. In an effort to steer him away from the device addiction, Marc confronts his son, bringing to light his own negative experiences with technology that altered his perceptions of reality. Marc’s emotional appeal causes Theo to realize he has inadvertently become a prisoner of his own dreams, unaware of the Nightmares that he has feared and conjured.

Choosing to face the Nightmares head-on, Theo, alongside Leena and Mira, strategizes a confrontation in the dream realm. The siblings embark on a quest to skirmish against their fears, drawing strengths from their memories while awakening the potential of creativity beyond the confines of the SleepSync. Theo recognizes that his imagination holds the key rather than the invasive technology, quickly sketching the landscapes on a dream canvas that becomes tangible and harnesses his will against the Nightmares. Facing a climactic confrontational moment where Marc's voice anchors him back to reality, Theo summons energy from the siblings’ relationship, temporarily banishing the Nightmares and freeing them from their dark silhouettes.

Upon awakening, Theo chooses to dismantle the SleepSync, fostering the courage needed to redefine what bedtime means to him: a time to acknowledge his fears and embrace genuine creativity without the interference of engineered sleep solutions. Marc supports Theo's newfound independence, encouraging family discussions about dreams openly and Klein abandoning the tech-heavy ideals that once drove them apart. Mira’s podcast evolves into a space of shared experiences and creativity exploration, inspiring others to celebrate their unique qualities. As the sun sets behind the neon skyline of their city, the Tanner family commits to cultivating a personalized bedtime ritual. They finally opt for it as a transformative moment, reconnecting with both dreams and each other, free from the anxieties of a world steeped in technology.
