In the year 2045, humanity’s relationship with sleep and bedtime has transformed dramatically due to advancements in technology. People no longer sleep when the sun goes down; instead, they adhere to a sophisticated schedule programmed by NeuroSync, a company that merges sleep patterns with gaming tech. In this new society, everyone wears personalized sleepware that monitors brainwaves and dreams, designating bedtime as both a health necessity and a competitive event. Mara, an ambitious sleep engineer, is dedicated to perfecting the NeuroSync system. Her younger brother, Izzy, has become enamored with the gaming aspect, while their mother, Elena, struggles to adjust to a world where sleep is less about rest and more about performance. Meanwhile, their father, a conspiracy theorist named Ron, suspects that NeuroSync is more about control than health.

Mara finds herself at the center of a new initiative to integrate Virtual Dream Environments (VDEs) into the bedtime experience, creating immersive dreamscapes customized to the individual’s desires. One evening, she invites family and friends to trial the latest VDE, which promises not just better sleep but exploration of one's dreams. The night starts animatedly, with Izzy zipping through thrilling dream worlds filled with adventure and Elena reliving cherished memories within comforting landscapes. However, Ron refuses to participate, adamant that any technology that manipulates dreams is a tool for indoctrination. As Mara grows frustrated with his skepticism, she realizes she must convince him of the benefits of this new era, unaware that Izzy accidentally triggers a glitch, rupturing the vivid dream world and leaving everyone trapped within malfunctioning dreamscapes.

Tension peaks as the VDE collapses into chaos, turning the dream environment into a nightmarishly surreal landscape where fears take form and escape routes vanish. Mara, Izzy, Elena, and Ron find themselves haunted by their personal anxieties and insecurities. Elena's guilt about being an inadequate mother manifests as a towering figure of disappointment, while Mara's perfectionism morphs into an unsettling reflection of herself, criticizing her every move. In contrast, Izzy faces distorted visions of failure in school and the burden of living up to his older sister’s reputation. Ron, forced to confront his isolationist views, is ducking from swirling shadows of paranoia brought to life by the technology he loathes. The family must confront not only the dangers of the glitching system but also their own internal conflicts.

As they fight to reclaim control over their dream experience, the family members begin to acknowledge their vulnerabilities, leading to poignant conversations about their lives and relationships. Together, they devise a way to harness the chaotic energies of the visual distortions. By addressing their fears head-on, they are able to reform the VDE's narrative structure, creating a collective dream filled with acceptance and support where each family member shares a central, comforting vision of their best selves. With every fear confronted, the glitch begins to dissolve, and they find themselves approaching the exit of the chaotic realm.

When the simulation finally collapses back into reality, the family awakens within the confines of their living room, blankets strewn about them like a protective cocoon. Although disoriented, they emerge closer than before, their perspectives permanently altered. Ron acknowledges that technology is not inherently harmful but requires conscious engagement, expressing his willingness to understand the advances for the sake of his family. Mara, inspired by the experience, reconsiders her process at NeuroSync, aiming to create systems that encourage genuine emotional expression. Thus, with bedtime redefined from mere performance back to a cherished familial experience, the four prepare to embark on enhanced sleep voyages together, united against their dreams and in life.
