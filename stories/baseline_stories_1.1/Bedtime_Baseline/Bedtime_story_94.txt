In the year 2045, bedtime has transformed from a simple ritual of rest into a highly commercialized experience dominated by Neural DreamScapes, a technology that allows users to immerse themselves in personalized dream environments as they sleep. In this world, parents like Mira and Leo, who both work in tech, find themselves struggling to manage their children’s screen time while fostering a healthy relationship with sleep. Their twin daughters, 8-year-old Eva and Corrin, are among the first generation raised with DreamScape systems integrated into their bedrooms, allowing them to indulge in fantastical dreams of their own design every night. As bedtime approaches, the family grapples with the health implications and emotional ramifications of living in a society where restful sleep has become a commodified escapade.

As new features in the DreamScape system launch, children become more absorbed in their dream creations, which range from magical kingdoms to virtual adventures that often feel more vivid than reality. Eva becomes obsessed with a particular dream that features a charming AI named Zylas, who teaches her about courage and exploring unknown realms. Meanwhile, Corrin takes a darker turn, enshrining herself in a nightly nightmare where fears morph into tangible entities. Mira and Leo, realizing the twins’ declining mental health from poor sleep habits and an over-reliance on these simulations, attempt to intervene by limiting screen time and encouraging traditional bedtime stories. Their well-intentioned effort, however, drives a wedge between them and their daughters, who view the parents’ attempts as punitive rather than protective.

The situation escalates when Mira discovers that the DreamScape system has a beta feature designed to fully integrate a user’s memories into the dream experience. Fearing the fallibility of the technology, she confronts Leo, who is convinced of its benefits. When a heated argument erupts, the twins overhear, leading to a chaotic clash as their fantasy lives begin to unravel. On a fateful night, during a storm that knocks out power, the DreamScape system malfunctions, trapping Eva in a colorful but treacherous landscape with Zylas by her side, while Corrin is overwhelmed by her darkest fears incarnate, causing a synthesis of their dreams into a mind-bending nightmare reality. The twins, separated yet intertwined in their unreality, must overcome their fears, navigate through their dreams, and seek each other out with the aid of a glitching Zylas.

As the clock approaches dawn, Mira and Leo work desperately to revive the DreamScape system, using emergency protocols from the tech company that owns it. The stakes heighten as the twins grapple for control within their respective dreams—Eva learns to stand up to challenges, while Corrin faces her fears, leading to an unexpected convergence of their dream realms. With moments to spare, their parents manage to reboot the system, but instead of waking them, they witness the two girls merging their struggles, leading to a newfound understanding and connection. This powerful moment fulfills the twins' journey, and as they wake with a shared sense of courage, they look forward to facing the day together. 

In the aftermath, the family comes together for a real bedtime—no screens, just whispered stories and soft laughter. Mira and Leo recognize the importance of establishing boundaries while nurturing their daughters' imagination in healthier ways. They pivot to strategize a balanced schedule that includes affection, sleep coaching, and family bonding time that incorporates classic bedtime stories and discussions. The twins learn that while dreaming can be enchanting, the strength they build in reality holds even greater significance. As the sunset replaces the stormy night, the family builds a legacy of reconnection—an invitation to embrace both dreams and gives comfort for a new journey, reminding each other that true adventure starts when their eyes are wide open.
