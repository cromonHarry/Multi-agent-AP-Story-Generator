In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has morphed into an intricate, high-tech experience shaping personal well-being and productivity. With the advent of NeuroSleep technology, citizens place a sleek, AI-enhanced headband on their heads at night, which calibrates sleep cycles and dreams according to their individual needs. While most people revel in deep, restorative sleep, glitches in the neural algorithms have caused rising issues. Among these citizens are Vera, a sleep technician responsible for monitoring dream patterns; her partner Leo, a skeptical journalist looking to expose the downsides of this technology; their neighbor Imani, a young single mother striving to balance work, motherhood, and her own chaotic nights; and Ezra, an elderly man haunted by memories and struggling against the effects of the world’s relentless drive for productivity.

Vera, working late one evening at the Dream Sync Corporation, discovers the system is experiencing frequent disruptions tied to a new software update. These glitches result in mixed dreams, where individuals encounter strange, traumatic experiences instead of the curated escapism promised. Concerned about the implications for her clients and her own loved ones, she arises an alarm within the company. As outsiders like Leo begin to report on the epidemic of sleep disturbances exacerbated by NeuroSleep malfunctions, public anxiety grows. Meanwhile, Imani’s son has been suffering severe night terrors since the update, raising her fears about unsafe technologies meant to enhance their bedtime ritual. Amidst this turmoil, Vera teams up with Leo, who reluctantly agrees to help uncover the truth, despite his prior reservations.

As public trust in NeuroSleep dwindles, secret meetings within the tech community reveal alarming truths: corporate greed has led to prioritizing profits over safety, and users had become unwitting guinea pigs in a vast experiment. Vera and Leo uncover that the company intentionally withheld adverse reports, fearing they would jeopardize stock prices. Meanwhile, Imani reaches her breaking point when her son’s dreams escalate into violent outbursts that bleed into his waking life. In a pivotal confrontation at Dream Sync, Ezra, who champions natural sleep practices after experiencing overwhelming PTSD from relying on technology, shares his harrowing experiences and rallies users to challenge the company's transparency.

Feeling the collective pulse of growing unease, Vera leads an uprising at Dream Sync, rallying sleep-deprived users, including Imani and Ezra, to reject the complacency of technological dependency. They launch a counter-campaign aimed at re-embracing natural sleep rituals, sharing the significance of intuitive rest beyond scientific manipulation. Their movement gathers momentum, prompting regulatory discussions and broader awareness around ethical AI use in daily life. While the face of Bedtime is changing, the importance of personal responsibility and healthy sleep is reborn, catalyzing a larger conversation about what it truly means to rest.

In the wake of their successful campaign, society begins a slow reclamation of bedtime customs, shifting back to nurturing sleep through connection and mindfulness rather than through hyper-technology. Imani finds solace in bedtime stories and shared moments with her son, guiding him past his nightmares. Vera’s commitment to ethical advancements in tech allows her to form a new, safer company focused on enhancing sleep health sustainably. Leo, having transformed through the experience, writes a series of exposés advocating the safety and emotional richness found in human connection over tech-saturated lives. As night falls, a new rhythm envelops the world—a refrain of sleep embracing humanity, reminding them that sometimes before the dawn, it’s okay to simply dream.
