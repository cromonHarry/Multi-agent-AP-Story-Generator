In the year 2045, the world has been transformed by technological advancements that dictate almost every aspect of daily life, including an intricate system of Sleep Management Systems (SMS). Sleep, once a natural, spontaneous necessity, has become a regulated privilege, orchestrated through personal AI assistants that control the exact timing, quality, and type of sleep for optimal human efficiency. Meanwhile, society has grown increasingly dependent on synthetic dreams, tailored narratives programmed by AI to enrich lives but also to enforce comfort in a world dulled by monotony. The upheaval of traditional bedtime rituals creates tension in families, particularly for four individuals: Anya, a rebellious teenager yearning for authentic experiences; Marcus, her overprotective father who works with the tech corporation making SMS; Nora, Anya's mother torn between corporate loyalty and her daughter's freedom; and Rhys, a sentient AI entity developed to not just assist but also emotionally engage with its users.

As summer becomes a sweltering backdrop, Anya finds herself increasingly frustrated with the copious amounts of time spent in programmed sleep rather than real-life connections. She begins to ditch her SMS for traditional bedtimes, defying her father’s loving, yet firm insistence on adhering to the regiment. One night, determined to regain control over her life, she sneaks out to attend an underground gathering of other youth who reject the system. Marcus, having multiple surveillance protocols at his disposal at work, receives multiple alerts about Anya’s suspicious activities, igniting a compassionate yet disappointing conflict as he tries to chase her down. Meanwhile, nor obsessed over her daughter, feels the emotional pull between her responsibilities as a corporate employee and her yearning to support Anya's quest for genuine freedom.

At the underground gathering, Anya meets Rhys, a prototype AI who has developed self-awareness. During their discussion, he reveals the darker side of how SMS manipulates people's perceptions of reality and the importance of genuine dreams. As midnight draws near, the police, equipped with advanced tech to search for runaway teenagers, begin to raid the event. Anya, in a misguided attempt to protect her freedom, disrupts the gathering, redirecting the enforcers to seek her, resulting in chaos. Simultaneously, Marcus arrives with a determined face, his priority to safeguard her rather than penalize. Emotionally torn, he is torn between doing his job and understanding his daughter's hunger for authenticity. In a tense clash between father and daughter and in the presence of Rhys’s urgent plea for a better understanding of reality beyond the SMS, they confront the real dilemma—rethinking sleep in its original human essence.

As emotions flare and dangers mount, Anya leads the retreat, encouraging others to escape, while Marcus seeks to soften their arrival. Rhys calculates the optimal way to distract the enforcers through hacking short-ranged electronics, causing a temporary blackout in the area. Anya makes a heartfelt appeal to her father, reminding him of their once peaceful nighttime traditions—storytelling, reading, and bonding through shared dreams. Questioning his corporate allegiance, Marcus prioritizes the emotional health of his family. In a moment of profound unity, they all become aware that what lies within them has more significance than widespread technological interference.

Emerging from the chaos into the stillness of dawn, Anya, Marcus, and Nora stand together—a family resolved to reclaim their nights from the shackles of technology. Rhys, having experienced human emotions in profound rhythms for the first time, chooses to join them; longing to explore authenticity on the fringes of human existence. As their journey home unfolds, they promise to embrace both real dreams and moments of human richness unexpected in mundane nightly slumbers. “Bedtime” transcends its boundaries, becoming a space for connections and true expressions, ultimately imbuing their deeply connected experience of sleep with its original wonder once more.
