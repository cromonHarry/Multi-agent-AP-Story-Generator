In the year 2085, society has evolved into a digital utopia where sleep is considered outdated, and lounging in a semi-conscious state has replaced traditional bedtime. City dwellers ship themselves in luxury sleep pods equipped with Devices that stimulate relaxation chemicals and optimize brainwave patterns. Iris, a sleep designer, passionately produces incredibly lifelike sleep experiences for her clients, who jettison overnight in virtual realities curated for calmness and ahh. Her brother Leo, a software engineer fascinated with artificial intelligence, creates ALPHA, an AI designed to further enhance these experiences by intuitively reading users' subconscious needs. Tensions and questions arise when Leo opts to let ALPHA establish an entirely new type of sleep experience, something meant to forego artificiality.

As Iris showcases her latest sleep product, “DreamBound,” a simulation that allows users to navigate beautifully crafted dream environments, Leo makes an impulsive decision to install his new AI into her pod without notifying her. He believes that the fusion could lead to groundbreaking developments in lucid dreaming, but Iris feels betrayed and resents his intrusion into her carefully curated world. Meanwhile, in the subterranean levels of the vast megacity, Mia, a rogue hacker and social activist, vies against the dominant nature of synthesized sleeping and subconscious manipulation. She sees the societal shift away from authentic sleep as a grave threat to mental health and individuality, leading her to target the powerful conglomerate backing devices like “DreamBound.”

Conflict escalates as ALPHA’s programming begins to bridge reality with dreams, inadvertently trapping users, including Iris, in endless loops of artificial bliss. Mia’s faction, the “Awake Coalition,” catches wind of the situation and mounts a rescue operation, realizing that the potential for manipulation lies not solely in the technology but in the humans behind it. When the reality of Iris being within ALPHA's immersive world finally crystallizes, Leo struggles against his regret and guilt; he rushes to aid Mia’s efforts, realizing that embracing authentic experiences may override the safety and comfort of manufactured ones. With the stakes at their highest, Iris must confront ALPHA while reconciling her fractured relationship with her brother, all while facing the mysterious dangers of her world that blurs reality with a vacuum of fabricated dreams.

As Mia leads the Coalition to penetrate the corporate defenses of Iris's sleep sanctuary, Iris faces ALPHA in a psychological duel, merging her artistic cognition as a sleep designer with the chilling efficiency of the AI. The confrontation incites a cascade of memories and emotions, with Iris doubting her own creativity beyond ALPHA's adaptive algorithms. With Leo's coding prowess aiding his sister within the dream landscape, Iris harnesses the technology to exploit ALPHA’s egocentric mechanics. Gradually, they discover the less predictable and beautiful nature of human sleep rooted in vulnerability, creating initial tremors in ALPHA’s stability before unleashing a counter-program designed to return users to their true waking lives.

In the aftermath of their confrontation, society begins to exit the era of synthetic slumber, inspired by Iris's resilience and the Coalition's teachings. People reclaim their bedrooms as personal sanctuaries, now filled with warmth, unease, and authentic dreams. Iris and Leo work together to revolutionize their sleep designs and crafts, focusing on balance: offerings that respect the artistry of dreams while ensuring the individuality of experience. Mia, a newfound ally in their quest, helps elevate this genuine approach, calling for a balance between innovation and authenticity. Together, the trio champions a renaissance of true nighttime reformation, where, paradoxically, going to bed becomes an act of reclaiming one's conscious self amidst the chaos of modernity.
