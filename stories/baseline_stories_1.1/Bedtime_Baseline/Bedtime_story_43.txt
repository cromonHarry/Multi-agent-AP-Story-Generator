In a near-future world ruled by the HyperNaptics Corporation, the traditional concept of "bedtime" has been completely revolutionized. Most humans no longer require sleep in the conventional sense; instead, they engage in bioweaved sleep hibernation pods that process dreams for emotional therapy and growth. Four friends, Mira, a sleep facilitator with a rebellious streak; Theo, a dream designer who crafts immersive experiences; Jade, a software engineer who harbors suspicions about the corporation; and Arlo, a corporate drone who believes fiercely in the technological advancements, find themselves at a crossroads when they learn of a glitch in the system affecting the latest sleep pods. This incident coincides with a string of missing persons within the city, touting whispers of a sinister connection between dreamprocessing and the disappearances.

Convinced that the pods may hold dark secrets beyond mere errors, Mira persuades her friends to investigate the origins of the malfunction. They penetrate the facade of HyperNaptics, using unauthorized access to attend dream-design meetings and testing. As the investigation progresses, they discover coded dreams implanted in users that manipulate emotions and thoughts while they 'sleep,’ leading them to question whether the traumatic nightmares connected to the missing individuals could be part of a more nefarious plan, with many missing swallowed up by the dreamy allure and left trapped in fully created dreamscapes. Jade, with her technical know-how, realizes that the code within the dreams can be hacked, but with that realization follows the risk of becoming casualties themselves within the virtual landscapes.

The friends devise a plan to infiltrate the hyperdream code and create an exit protocol—a personal bedtime routine that would rescue those lost and expose HyperNaptics’ corruption. They assemble at Mira’s cramped apartment transformed into a war room where late-night brainstorming evolves into a digital battleground. The emotionally-charged atmosphere escalates as they wrestle with enticing alternate realities, grappling with their own fears and desires. When the strike against the code is initiated, they breach the core, released into a fevered dreamscape unlike any previous models. Each friend faces haunting personal nightmares, reflecting their innermost wishes and regrets, and they must navigate through emotions both foreign and familiar to retrieve those who have been sucked into the digital abyss.

As they confront their worst fears and darkest dreams, the bond between the friends strengthens in unseen ways, yet tensions rise. Just as the situation becomes dire, they reach a pivotal threshold, where Theo’s artistry and Jade’s analytical abilities combine to reveal pathways out of their nightmares, allowing them to stare down their personal demons and continue on toward the exit. Fueled by newfound strength, they manipulate the coding from within to create an escape route for the trapped, pushing through a climax of self-discovery and agency that could liberate them all but also invaluable to Rita and the others hanging by threads in a world of false security.

Emerging into a new dawn, Mira, Theo, Jade, and Arlo, battered but whole, witness an awakening city; news spreads of the truth behind HyperNaptics, igniting a movement towards reform in dream technology and ethics. Their friendship, fortified in the ultimate testing ground, enables them to navigate the ever-blurring lines between dreams and reality, empowering others while setting their sights on a true bedtime where humanity can reclaim sleep—and the dangers of manufactured dreams can be safely kept at bay. With bittersweet lessons, they embrace their vulnerabilities and ambitions, reminding the world that real dreams can only be crafted when awake, and only then can sleep be a true refuge again.
