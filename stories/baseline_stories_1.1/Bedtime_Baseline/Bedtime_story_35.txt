In the year 2142, the notion of bedtime has undergone a radical transformation. Society, driven by technology and the relentless pursuit of productivity, has largely abandoned traditional sleep. People now rely on sophisticated "Sleepless" modules implanted in their brains, allowing them to operate on minimal rest while remaining alert and functional almost around the clock. As a result, children are raised with augmented capabilities, thriving on short power naps programmed into their schedules. The resurgence of traditional bedtime concepts feels foreign to most; vibrant dreams are traded for kinetic visions of augmented reality, shaped by the wild imaginations of their private AI mentors. Four friends—Nina, Leo, Maisie, and Rufus—grapple with the implications of living in this awake-at-all-hours world, exploring their abandoned childhood fears and dreams that linger in the corners of their minds.

One evening, as the outlines of bedtime stories whisper forgotten feels, the group discovers an underground community that champions a movement called "Resonate." This collective believes in the power of deep sleep and the forgotten stories tied to it. Ruled by an enigmatic figure named Lorelei, they host illegal bedtime sessions in secret locations, tangling the threads of nostalgia with the essential urge to reconnect to their unconscious desires. Intrigued, the quartet attends a session where they participate in immersive dream-sharing experiences. Here, the group matures into fluent dream-weavers—skilling themselves in lucid dreaming techniques and struggling to let their dreams confront their repressed thoughts. However, as they delve deeper into these experiences, bursts of fear arise that threaten to reduce their progress to chaos.

The climax disrupts their group dynamics when Leo, a lifelong achiever, becomes addicted to dream manipulation. He struggles with enforcing his version of a perfect world during sleep, convinced his crafting of dreams is superior, even attempting to eliminate the imperfections of the others’ perspectives. Passion turns sour, tensions rise, and sharp divides split the formerly tight-knit group. Nina, resolute to confront the unsettling shifts, challenges Leo on his approach to control. Rufus and Maisie also become embroiled, either trying to defend Leo's unraveling identity or maintaining their own agency in the shared dream realm. In a dramatic dream clash, visions unleash their inner fears—aged avatars, lost memories, and destabilized realities, rendering Leo’s refuge perilous as he risks losing himself entirely.

As the dust settles from their memorable dream duel, each character begins to navigate the aftermath of their experiences and the reality they share while awake. Leo emerges from nightmares stripped of control, traumatized yet enlightened. In an unexpected twist, he accepts the vulnerability that dreaming entails, paving the way to embracing imperfections in the world and his friends. Meanwhile, Maisie takes on role of dream steward—an advocate for nurturing a sacred bedtime ritual, gradually persuading her friends to explore these nighttime escapades more positively. Together, they rekindle their friendship, blending lived experiences with newfound understanding of rest and dreams.

In the days that follow, a transformation takes root in the community. As nighttime returns to take center stage, Resonate flourishes, gaining traction beyond its secretive clubs, enticing others to re-explore sleep as part of a balanced existence. With sleeping pods being regulated instead of banned, a movement blossoms. Nina, Leo, Maisie, and Rufus lead this charge while challenging society to reevaluate performance metrics and productivity norms around rest. Together, they cultivate a universe where the warmth of bedtime stories intermingles with tender dreams—a reminder to pause and connect with imagination and one another before stepping back into the day.
