In the year 2085, the concept of "bedtime" has been utterly transformed by technological advancements and societal shifts. Children no longer sleep at the traditional hour; instead, they connect to a communal Dream Network that syncs their subconscious, allowing them to share fantasies and experiences for educational and entertainment purposes. In this world, sleep is no longer a solitary endeavor. Ten-year-old Lyra is an enthusiastic participant in the Dream Network, but she finds herself struggling with the increasing demands of her parents, Zara, a top-tier engineer constantly optimizing the Network, and Theo, an exhausted emergency responder frequently away on duty. Her best friend, Max, harbors a secret desire to disconnect from the Network and rediscover a deeper, personal dreamlife, a notion increasingly frowned upon in their peer society.

As the story unfolds, a faults report emerges about the Dream Network, leading to eerie occurrences among its users: nightmares proliferate, and shared dreams turn sinister, affecting many children. Lyra, who has always relied on the Dream Network for escapism from her parents' pressure, begins experiencing unsettling nightmares, revealing hidden fears about her family's emotional isolation. Meanwhile, Max’s older sister, Camille—a determined journalist—undertakes the risky task of investigating the safety and implications of the Dream Network. Max, torn between loyalty to Lyra and his desire to escape the faulty network, convinces her to join him in seeking out unconventional sources of knowledge about sleep.

The climax occurs when Kyra and Max decide to do the unthinkable: they log off the Dream Network completely for the first time, deciding to explore the real world and initiate their private sleep cycle using the ancient methods of bedtime. They journey to a forgotten part of the city known for its lush parks—one of the last remnants of untouched nature. Here, they discover an underground group that promotes healthy sleep habits through meditation, literature, and personal dreams. Their time together leads to bonding moments as they confront their anxieties and embrace the joy of choice. Just as their newfound understanding of rest and human connection begins to flourish, a massive malfunction in the network sends shockwaves through the entire system.

As chaos erupts within the network, children who remain logged in suffer widespread panic, and Camille, armed with her findings about the detrimental consequences of the Dream Network, unites families to tackle the crisis. Lyra realizes the importance of dreaming alone and reconnects with her parents in a moment of vulnerability. Together, they campaign against the Network’s dangers, now fully aware of its manipulative environment. Max supports Lyra, and together they help raise awareness concerning the value of real sleep over network dreams. The escape from digital chains leads to public discourse regarding privacy, dreams, and the essence of childhood.

In the final resolution, a new organization emerges, spearheaded by parents and advocates, promoting a balanced relationship with technology. Lyra’s family begins to adopt bedtime routines filled with books and stories that celebrate individual experiences. Families rediscover the art of storytelling, filling the silent spaces once occupied by aware impersonal connections. Max finds joy in meditative techniques that make dreamtime experiences personal again. As for the children, the concept of bedtime gains a new meaning, transforming into a precious time for reflection and growth, symbolizing a harmonious balance between technology and natural human experience.
