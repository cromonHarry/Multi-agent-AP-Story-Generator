In the year 2045, society has transformed the notion of "Bedtime" into an elaborate ritual dictated by advanced technology. Citizens rely on the NeuroSleep, a biometric device that syncs with their brainwaves and maintains a global schedule for optimal sleep cycles. Families gather each night to engage in a virtual "bedtime" orchestrated by an AI called Nox, which curates personalized dreamscapes that cater to their emotional states and personal ambitions. Among these families are Anaya, a single mother yearning for genuine connections; Leo, her teenage son who struggles with anxiety; Dr. Simon Reed, the creator of NeuroSleep trying to showcase the benefits of his invention; and Mia, Simon’s estranged wife who believes the technology has irrevocably altered human intimacy.

As Anaya gets ready for another night immersed in virtual dreams that feel more real than her waking life, tension builds in her household. Leo resists using the NeuroSleep device, convinced that dreams dictated by technology rob him of true fantasy, until he finds himself isolated from friends who embrace the experience. Dr. Reed faces a moral dilemma about his creation; after extensive research, he discovers that prolonged use of NeuroSleep is causing emotional atrophy in users. Meanwhile, Mia confronts Simon about the profound impacts their invention is having on real-life relationships, expressing deep concern that love and vulnerability are becoming obsolete in a world where every desire can be summoned with the touch of a button.

One fateful night, the families experience a glitch in the NeuroSleep system. Instead of personalized dreams, they are thrust into a chaotic collective nightmare that draws out their innermost fears and regrets. Anaya encounters the ghost of her late husband, arguing over her dependence on technology to cope with loneliness, while Leo faces an empty void symbolizing his isolated reality. Dr. Reed is trapped in a labyrinth of his own making, where the visions of a loveless future confront him at every turn, and Mia is forced to relive memories of intimacy now strained since the advent of the AI. The starkness of this shared nightmare forces all four to confront their relationships with each other and with technology.

As the group struggles to wake from their joint psychological prison, they realize the only way out is to embrace vulnerability and confront their fears together. Anaya reaches out to Leo, acknowledging that she has relied heavily on virtual experiences to fill the void left by her husband’s death. Simon and Mia find themselves navigating a landscape full of unresolved issues, and in their confrontation, they rediscover the depth of genuine connection that had vanished with their reliance on the technology they once created. The nightmare serves not just as a trial, but as a catalyst, helping each character face their realities and seek out authentic emotions they had buried.

After their harrowing experience, the NeuroSleep system is reconfigured to allow for dream customization without sacrificing genuine connections. Anaya and Leo establish a nightly ritual of reading stories together, igniting their bond anew. Dr. Reed makes the ethical decision to introduce a version of the technology that emphasizes human relationships and feelings over mere escapism, collaborating with Mia to create workshops promoting emotional awareness. With a renewed understanding of "Bedtime," families across the world shift toward embracing both technology and the intimacy that comes from conscious emotional effort. In this brave new world, the idea of sleep evolves yet again, uniting dreaming and reality into a harmonious cycle of healing and connection.
