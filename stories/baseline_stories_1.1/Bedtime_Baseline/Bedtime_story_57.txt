In the year 2042, humanity has developed a sophisticated technology known as DreamStream, which utilizes neural implants to curate and stream personalized dream experiences during sleep. In this world, "Bedtime" is no longer just a time for rest; it has become a luxurious event filled with elaborate dream scenarios chosen based on users' deepest desires and fears. At the center of this story is Ava, a ten-year-old girl who has become obsessed with the vibrant fantasy worlds created by DreamStream. Her single mother, Lila, works as a Dream Architect, designing dream experiences for wealthy clients, and struggles to connect with her daughter when bedtime becomes a battleground over desires and expectations. They are joined by Noah, Ava’s weary yet hopeful neighbor, who secretly harbors a desire to experience the real-world joys he has long suppressed; and Morg, an AI cotton candy cloud with feelings, who serves as both an entertainer and a personal guardian for children using DreamStream.

One evening, Ava discovers that her dreams have been monitored and modified by commercial interests, basically turning her subconscious into a free marketing tool. This revelation sends a jolt of anxiety through Ava, amplifying her yearning for a bedtime experience untainted by corporate influence. Just as she feels lost in this manufactured dreamscape, she meets a mysterious boy named Kai in her dreams, who is a self-engineered child living in a dystopian parallel linked to unwanted dreams. Kai pulls on her heartstrings, revealing how DreamStream has scarred children by plucking their treasured moments, replacing them with consumerist fantasies. Frightened, yet inspired, Ava confides in Lila and Noah about her disconcerting revelations, encouraging them to seek truth beyond the empowered facade of DreamStream.

In a bold move with Noah and Morg, Ava resolves to break free from their pre-set dream experiences and venture deeper into the remnants of the unmanipulated subconscious world that DreamStream devours. They sneak into Lila’s Dream Architect Lab after dinner, aiming to forge a connection with the origin code of DreamStream, hoping to unlock the potential for authentic dreams. As they navigate through a web of adventure and uncertainty, they are confronted by Lila, still encapsulated in her work-driven haze but seeing flashes of her daughter’s yearning for reality in the chaos. Sensing she could either continue to stifle this authenticity or embrace it, Lila becomes torn between the corporate machine she builds for a living and the nurturing mother she longs to be.

The climax reaches a fever pitch when they tap into the DreamStream’s central nexus, unleashing a cascade of vivid memories lost to the system—laughter, friendship, and family that once existed within them. This prompts an awakening, and all four characters are overwhelmed by haunting yet familiar echoes from their pasts. Lila recalls her own childhood dreams and realizations as she faces her codependency on DreamStream, while Noah’s repressed memories surface, enabling him to finally confront his fears. They challenge the algorithm, introducing humanity into the equation by rewriting and renegotiating the bedtime parameters themselves.

As the dreamscape morphs into a collective tapestry of imagination, Lila decides to reclaim her daughter's dreams while embracing the unfiltered chaos that comes with authentic dreaming. They unify as a family, including Morg in their decisions, vowing to offer untimed authentic bedtime rituals that celebrate genuine imagination rather than commodification. In this newfound harmony, bedtime becomes a sacred time again, where they share laughter, create stories, and explore additive journeys together rather than passively consuming. Within this intimate circle of authenticity, Ava finally drifts off to sleep, where true dreams await, while a reflective Lila understands that amidst the mundane and the extraordinary interlink, there lies the beauty of their shared humanity.
