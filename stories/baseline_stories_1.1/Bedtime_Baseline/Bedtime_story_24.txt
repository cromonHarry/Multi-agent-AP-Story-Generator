In the year 2045, society has transitioned fully into a world dominated by Technology Sleep Systems (TSS), a combination of neural synchronization devices and virtual reality environments that promise enhanced sleep experiences. Emily, a single mother and VR programmer, struggles to adjust to this new norm. Her daughter, Zoe, a curious ten-year-old, has embraced the TSS's allure, crafting endless fantasies within its simulated worlds. In contrast, Miles, a once-famous author turned reluctant Luddite, resentfully declines to use sleep technology, fearing it disconnects people from their dreams and imaginations. Meanwhile, their shared sentiment comes from Henry, an elderly neighbor who cherishes traditional bedtime routines, telling stories of the past as he battles the pressures of a society that dismisses natural sleep in favor of artificial enhancement.

As bedtime approaches, Emily finds herself caught in a struggle: caught between her job’s demand to promote enhanced sleep experiences and her desire to foster a deeper connection with Zoe. After a long day managing TSS installations at her tech firm, the two find it increasingly difficult to engage without the allure of virtual spaces that swallow Zoe’s attention. Seeking some semblance of normalcy, Emily invites Miles over to share a true story at bedtime, hoping to reignite that old fire of imagined adventures—an activity both terrifying and glimmering with the promise of reconnecting her family. However, tensions arise as Miles resists modern comforts, viewing the TSS as the root of disconnection, while Zoe grows more attached to her virtual realms, dismissive of any real-world storytelling.

As the night unfolds, sparks fly when the group gathers at Emily's home. Milks will slip into a discussion that captures Zoe's imagination, while Emily uses her programming skills to create a resourceful blend of the real and virtual. She proposes a compromise: to combine elements of TSS with storytelling, allowing Zoe to choose avatars inspired by mythical characters from the stories Miles recounts. As they showcase this blend of virtual immersion supplemented by real narratives, Zoe begins to straddle an intriguing world, torn between an innovative version of bedtime and the ordinary, cherished experiences with her mother and neighbor.

Yet, the cheats and shortcuts of the TSS start showing distressing signs: technology glitches, fractured dream realms, and Zoe experiencing vivid nightmares that transform into reflections of her unresolved emotional turmoil. A crisis point arises when Zoe, unable to distinguish real dreams from artificial constructs, experiences a nightmarish breakdown. As Emily and Miles grapple with this newfound threat, Miles realizes the value of Emily’s blend, urging her to step up and guide Zoe back to the wonders of authentic dreams while navigating the emotions swirling beneath the surface of their tech-infused world.

In the aftermath of the nightmarish collapse, Emily embraces a newfound resolve to reclaim bedtime rituals alongside their tech-enhanced adventures. They pivot towards balancing imaginative storytelling with the TSS, forging a healthy space where dreams can flourish rather than merely succumb to technology. As they coalesce in a shared bedtime journey, Zoe learns to find wonder in both the virtual and the real, finally grasping the essence of real community. Bedtime transforms into a sanctuary where bonds reignited are accompanied by an expansive sense of wonder, reminding them all that the essence of slumber lies in their shared stories, dreams, and love, rather than any technology that simulates it.
