In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed dramatically due to widespread advancements in technology. Society no longer relies solely on sleep for psychological and physical rejuvenation. Instead, a global system known as Somatrix monitors individuals' biocycles and leverages virtual reality pods to simulate optimal dream environments. In the heart of New Geneva, a vibrant hub of innovation, four friends—Nina, a tenacious neuroscientist; Marco, a free-spirited artist; Ava, a software engineer with a curious mind; and Leo, a full-time dream architect—embark on a quest that challenges the very relationship between humanity and sleep. While most citizens embrace the concocted dreams crafted by the Somatrix algorithms, Nina begins to suspect that the artificial simulations are eroding the essence of human subconsciousness. 

Holdings signs of restlessness, Nina rallies her friends to investigate. Armed with knowledge from her neurology background, she notes the growing occurrences of "synthetic insomnia"—a condition afflicting those who opt for virtual slumber. In a clandestine meeting, they devise a plan to infiltrate the Somatrix mainframe, determined to unearth the implications of their state-sponsored slumber. Meanwhile, Marco explores unorthodox techniques for manual dreaming, desperate to rediscover the chaotic beauty of nightmares. As they delve into their individual endeavors, they realize their dreams are interwoven. One evening, while just outside a Somatrix facility, Nina stumbles upon a disgruntled technician who reveals that the virtual experiences are based on subpar historical data about genuine human dreams—an idea that frightens Nina to her core.

The simmering tension reaches its peak when they discover that Somatrix is preparing to launch a new update aimed at eliminating the last vestiges of natural sleep. During their infiltration, they are caught, leading to a tense face-off with Somatrix security. A catastrophic malfunction occurs when they activate a sequence that disrupts the feeding systems for the VR pods, plunging New Geneva into sleepless chaos. As people exponentially awaken and confront the dissonance between their false experiences and reality, Nina and her friends realize the gravity of their actions. They must now not only escape the consequences but also address the turmoil their city faces as everyone grapples repressed memories and emotions that had long lain dormant.

Detached from the structure of artificial dreams, the citizens start recollecting flashes of real experiences, both joyful and painful, leading to meltdowns in the streets. They struggle to process the blend of vivid memories resurfacing that challenge their identities formed in a virtual bubble. The friends strive to guide the people towards relying on mental techniques that encourage introspection and natural dream recovery. Fueled by raw emotion and a fierce bond among themselves, they lead through the streets, preaching the importance of both dreaming and nightmares. The fate of their friends and the entire population rests on their ability to rekindle the humanness drained away by technology.

In the fallout of the chaos, the friends emerge as reluctant heroes, willing to take charge of defining a new "Bedtime" in New Geneva, altering how dreams are perceived forever. With systems reverted and the minds of citizens no longer shackled to superficial sleep, entire communities begin sharing authentic dreams and vulnerabilities. A sense of unity burgeons as each individual learns to navigate their own imagination, teasing out personal meaning lost in synthetic replacements. Nina, Marco, Ava, and Leo—after pivotal growth—now seek to design a new dream network, blending the best of innovation with the need for humanity’s primal connection to dreams and the restorative power they inherently possess, recognizing that dreams can bridge past and future alongside progress and the human spirit. Laying foundations for a new era, bedtime as a concept comes full circle, guiding civilization back to what it truly means to dream.
