In the year 2045, nighttime has transformed dramatically in a world governed by the NeuroSync Corporation. The traditional concept of "Bedtime" is obsolete; instead, citizens plug into a shared Dreamscape that cultivates sublime dreams as a service. Evie, a melancholic robotics engineer disenchanted by the routine of her engineered dreams, longs for the escape of a traditional sleep. Her brother, Leo, a Dreamscape designer, believes in the power of shared experiences, despite being haunted by his protagonist avatar, who repeatedly fails his missions. Then there’s Naomi, an activist resisting the predatory nature of NeuroSync, determined to reveal the darker side of enforced shared dreaming. Lastly, there’s Jasper, a collector of ancient bedtime stories, who hopes to keep humanity’s dreams alive. Together, they find themselves on the precipice of uncovering the corporation's hidden agendas.

As Evie struggles with her dissatisfaction and a series of odd glitches interrupting her nightly dreams, she crosses paths with Naomi at an underground assembly. Naomi reveals the truth: NeuroSync harvests real-world emotions from the dreamers for profit, using their nightmares to curate a portfolio of commoditized fears. Inspired by Naomi's revelations, Evie initiates a plan to dive deeper into the Dreamscape, intending to expose the charismatic but sinister CEO, Amara Huxley. Leo, caught between loyalty to his corporate job and his sister’s convictions, reluctantly joins the duo, while Jasper provides historical context, reciting bedtime lore infused with cautionary tales against losing one's humanity.

The group infiltrates a clandestine Dreamscape hub, where they confront Huxley and her army of sentinels—dream avatars designed to protect their secrets. The air crackles with tension as Evie and her team access encrypted systems leading to distressing revelations about the corporation’s experimental processes involving dream coercion. When Leo inadvertently becomes trapped in a loop of his own failed dreams—haunting reflections of his inadequacies—Evie races against time to free him. Clarity strikes when Jasper shares an ancient tale of resilience that fuels a powerful dream to empower Leo to confront his fears. United in their truest selves, the group strategizes to expose the deception that stitches their society together.

Having worked through their fears, imagination reignites, and they expose data implicating NeuroSync’s exploitation of dreamers, broadcasting it to their connected populous. In the wake of their revelations, the Dreamscape begins to fracture, with users experiencing real tremors as the boundaries of their shared dreams dissolve. Huxley attempts to contain the chaos, but Naomi’s findings spark a movement advocating for the revitalization of sleep. The group’s escapade emboldens the citizens to demand autonomy over their dreams and rejection of NeuroSync's grasp, utilizing the ancient stories shared by Jasper to inspire a cultural revival.

In the aftermath, society begins to reclaim individual bedtimes, reinvesting in the lost art of quiet moments and personal slumber. Evie returns to her robotics career, pioneering technology that allows for autonomous sleep experiences that promote mental well-being. Leo utilizes his design prowess to create an inclusive platform that honors personal dreamscapes while always allowing a doorway to traditional sleep. They found a community space housing bedtime story hours—where Jasper plays an integral role, sharing tales of adventure that inspire the youth to explore their imaginations. Ultimately, the world learns to balance the digital with the organic, finding comfort in the letting go as they drift to sleep, knowing they are in control of their dreams once more.
