In the year 2045, the world has transformed through the advancement of immersive virtual reality technology, leading to a radical shift in how society perceives "bedtime." In this future, sleep is no longer a passive state but an interactive experience, managed by Bedtime Architects—specialists who design personalized dreamscapes for individuals. Sarah, a world-renowned Bedtime Architect, is celebrated for her innovative dream environments, while her husband, Tom, a sleep scientist, studies the effects of this virtual escapism on human health. Their teenage daughter, Mia, absorbed in mainstream culture influenced by unrealistic cyber-dreams, grapples with the consequences of virtual slumber. A mysterious figure named Leo, a rebellious coder, believes that the reliance on curated dreams diminishes human connection and creatively seeks a way to disrupt the status quo.

As the lines between virtual and physical intimacy blur, Sarah becomes increasingly concerned about Mia's emotional detachment, which coincides with her own commitment to her work. Sarah's latest project—a feature that integrates AI with personal memories—ushers in a new era of fully customized dream experiences, attracting the attention of corporate magnates eager to monopolize self-care. However, Leo, discontent with his increasingly alienated lifestyle, seeks Sarah out—not to maliciously disrupt her work, but to appeal to her sense of ethics. He believes that distorted dreams are trapping people, and he seeks to enlist her help to introduce a counter-program that emphasizes raw, unfiltered experiences instead. As their professional worlds intertwine, Tom struggles to keep Mia grounded, fearing the drastic impact of constant immersion on her well-being.

Tensions peak when Mia begins to exhibit signs of withdrawal from reality. One evening, as she prepares to enter her latest dreamscape, she hesitates, plagued by doubts instilled by Leo's interviews about the dangers of artificial sedation. She confronts her parents, expressing her urge to experience the real world—a world they too have become compromised in. Simultaneously, Sarah is invited to present her pioneering dream-art at a conference, leading her to reflect on her priorities. Knowing personally the fragility of their family bond, she grapples with her legacy in a culture that glorifies artificiality over authenticity.

Mia's confrontation with her parents spurs action. The night of Sarah's conference, Mia sneaks away to join Leo, convinced that they must expose the empty promises of the dream industry. Together, they hack into the grand system, creating a live broadcast that disrupts a major dream process, forcing individuals to face the stark realities they are avoiding. This culminates in a chaotic interference that reveals the accumulated costs of their reliance on crafted dreams—the loss of individuality, reality, and genuine emotions.

The aftermath of the broadcast creates ripples throughout society. Sarah reconvenes with Mia and Tom, finally understanding the impact of her work on her family's dynamics. Joined by Leo, they reflect upon their powerful confrontation with the ethereal yet culture-stripping nature of current sleep technology. As cities turn to this new awakening, Sarah restructures her dream architecture to incorporate breathers—brief moments of reality forced into dream immersive experiences. They pledge to utilize their talents to guide people back to value authentic connections and the imperfect world around them, establishing a precedent where "bedtime" signifies not an escape, but once again, a safe harbor for growth and healing.
