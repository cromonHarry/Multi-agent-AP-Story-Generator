In the near future, the concept of bedtime has transformed dramatically. Due to advancements in technology, society now operates on a system known as "Sleeptime Regulation," a biomechanical infrastructure designed to optimize human rest and productivity. The world has adopted a rigorous schedule where all citizens are mandated to synchronize their sleep cycles using personalized neural patterns projected through wearable sleep enhancers. Ava, a Sleep Systems Analyst, struggles to adapt as her role demands constant vigilance over the population's sleep data. Meanwhile, her brother, Max, an underground activist opposing the government’s regulation, believes in the natural chaos of sleep and wakes to spread the message that autonomy in slumber is essential to true freedom.

As Ava delves deeper into the algorithms that govern people's sleep, she uncovers an alarming anomaly—a new neuro-liminal code that is causing unpredictable dreams and sleep-related compliances. Max's protests are gaining strength, attracting the attention of those feeling oppressed by the clockwork of their lives. The duo finds themselves at odds, with Ava torn between her duty to enforce the system and her lingering connection to Max's beliefs. Their conversations grow heated as Max shares harrowing stories of people suffering from distressing sleep states, asserting that true rest requires a break from the regulated form of "proper" sleep.

In an unexpected twist, Ava discovers that their mother, Maeve, an esteemed scientist who was pivotal in establishing the Sleeptime Regulation, has been secretly reworking the neural codes to reflect her own ideas on individual sleep patterns. Maeve's motivations are shrouded in chaos theory; she wants to reinsert unpredictability into the sleep cycles to foster creativity. However, her experimentation has inadvertently drawn the ire of the governing bodies protecting the established order, making her a target of despicable forces. The siblings unite, realizing the depth of Maeve’s influence, and loan her support while grappling with their diverging beliefs on the nature of sleep.

As political unrest escalates, a crackdown on the dissenting populace ensues. Waking hours are regulated, feeding more anxiety into their hidden disturbance. During a staged raid on one of Max's underground gatherings, the trio narrowly escapes with a small community of protestors. In their quest to prepare for their final push against Sleeptime Regulation, they learn to embrace shared experiences of dreams, forging a plan to inject Maeve’s naturalistic ethos into the system during a high-profile initiative called the “Sleeptime Horizon” event—a crowning amalgamation of governance and technology showcased annually to the public.

In the aftermath, society is thrown into disarray; the debut of the new code during Sleeptime Horizon creates a playful awakening among the populace. People start to rediscover the marvel of conscious dreaming and the joy of spontaneous bedtime. Public sentiment shifts, and Maeve’s rogue modifications fulfill their potential for liberation. As communities rejuvenate in new styles of sleep engagement—shared dreams, dreamscapes that blend realities, and non-conformist sleep schedules—Ava embraces her brother’s ideology, resigned to shape a world where bedtime becomes not a punishment, but an adventurous transitions into rest, creativity, and freedom. The siblings watch as humanity begins to reclaim their right to dream in an unscripted world, celebrating the end of imposed slumber regulations.
