In the year 2047, society has embraced the concept of a “Sleep Economy” — a highly regulated structure where sleep is commoditized and sold as a rare luxury, due to a global epidemic of insomnia caused by pervasive digital distractions and a relentless pace of life. Families now trade sleep credits, and children are enrolled in specialized sleep schools from a young age, where they are conditioned to fall asleep on command through a blend of technology and hypnosis. Mia, a spirited eleven-year-old, resists this artificial bedtiming practice and craves the spontaneity of genuine sleep, accompanied by fairy tales and her grandma's loving touch. Her best friend Lucas, a tech-savvy rebel, supports her quest for natural slumber despite being trapped in a sleep-training program. Their beloved teacher, Ms. Rosell, seems to embody the new normal but secretly yearns for an echo of the past, and Freddy, an elderly neighbor who’s wise and quirky, offers them segments of forgotten lore about bedtime stories.

As the Sleep Economy tightens, strict regulations on sleep credits lead to frustrations among families, especially as bedtimes are synced with increasingly invasive “Sleep Sync” devices. Mia's parents become entangled in the web of societal pressure, desperately exchanging their meager credits for an alchemical sleep serum that promises to deliver four hours of deep dreamless sleep. Feeling like her individuality is vanishing under this oppressive structure, Mia recruits Lucas and sketches out an audacious plan to break free once and for all. They hack into the “Citywide Sleep Network,” trying to exploit its flaws, but soon confront a society that frowns upon such rule-breaking — a labyrinth of stern enforcements led by Ms. Rosell, who finds herself torn between her responsibilities as an educator and her growing empathy for Mia's plight.

The children journey deeper into the city's underbelly, where renegade groups consisting of sleep advocates have formed to gather precious stories and foster natural sleeping habits. Abandoning their devices, they listen to old bedtime stories, where dreamers can escape to worlds without digital confines. With each tale they hear, they reclaim pieces of themselves — lessons on curiosity and the beauty of wonder. Escaping the employ of the Citywide Sleep Network, Mia, Lucas, and their newfound friends confront Ms. Rosell at a community meeting about the alarming rise of sleep deprivation. There, the lines are drawn; Mia pleads her case, representing a generation yearning for rest and rejuvenation that feels real but re-imagined, while a chilling silence hangs in consequence of generations of regulatory teachings.

The climax approaches when Ms. Rosell eventually takes the podium, wrestling with the recognition of old values amidst rigid norms. Instead of suppressing the children’s ideas, she begins to interpret entrance to the community in light of Mia’s revelations. As the leaders of the Sleep Economy watch with dismay, Ms. Rosell proposes free community sleep-sessions, like those from the old days when children and parents would lull together rather than render sleep as a finite transaction. The initiative sparks hope and has backlash against authority — what they'll gain from these nighttime gatherings intersects with their sense of humanity, raising questions on what it really means to dream.

In the ensuing days, the atmosphere begins to shift. Families tentatively return to the essence of bedtime rituals, reconnecting with traditions of storytelling that shape their kids' minds before slumber. The new Sleep Economy, though still present, slowly loses grip over its proverbial stranglehold, and a grassroots sleep renaissance begins. Mia’s family sees their nighttimes evolve, woven closely with laughter and love, and kids everywhere experiment with books and dreams, affiliated not with credits but with creativity. Lessons from mythical tales fill their minds, making them richer amidst the slumber of inevitability. Though challenges remain, the seeds of unity and natural awakening flourish, reminding them all that the most restorative sleep comes from heartbeats heard, not just credits exchanged.
