In the year 2045, societal norms surrounding sleep and rest have dramatically transformed with the advent of Sleep Integration Technology (SIT). People now rely on smart environments that tailor their bedrooms and sleep cycles to maximize productivity and enhance dreams. Families have moved away from conventional bedtime rituals in favor of fully immersive sleep experiences facilitated by artificial intelligence. In this world, Elysia, an ambitious bioengineer, lives in the bustling city of Neo Eden with her partner, Kiran, a virtual reality designer. They have a five-year-old daughter, Zara, who exhibits peculiar behaviors regarding sleep. Elysia's estranged mother, Helena, a traditionalist who resisted the changes in society, suddenly reenters their lives, concerned for Zara's well-being amidst the fast-paced technological landscape.

As bedtime approaches, Elysia and Kiran prepare to connect their AI interfaces to guide Zara into her nightly dreamscape. However, Zara hesitates, fearful of the artificial experiences that have dominated her life. She finds comfort in the bedtime stories her grandmother used to tell, longing for the warmth and intimacy forged through genuine storytelling. Elysia, caught between her devotion to innovation and her daughter’s emotional needs, begins to question whether technology has replaced the comfort of traditional bedtime rituals. The presence of Helena complicates matters further as she expresses skepticism about the impact of SIT on Zara's development, sparking tension between her and Elysia.

One evening, a power outage disrupts the scheduled wake-sympathety, the technique that synchronizes sleep cycles for optimal productivity. In the ensuing chaos, the family gathers around a candle in the living room as the alarms for their technologies blink uselessly in the dark. Unplugged for the first time in ages, Zara's initial anxiety transforms into excitement as she remembers her grandmother's stories. Elysia and Kiran reluctantly join the storytelling, bringing to life adventure tales filled with imaginative worlds and profound lessons and emotions. This rare instance of genuine connection in the face of modern chaos brings an unexpected warmth that any gadget struggles to replicate.

With the power restored, Elysia is torn between returning to the familiarity of SIT or embracing a new form of bedtime for her family. Faced with the choice, she observes Zara—younger, more hopeful in the absence of technology—vibrantly envisioning the worlds spun from her grandmother’s imagination. A deep conflict arises within Elysia as she realizes that the efficiency afforded by technology fails to prioritize the emotional foundation of family bonds. After a candid conversation with Kiran about Zara’s needs and the role of tradition, they choose to redefine "bedtime" together on their own terms, blending the wonder of storytelling with the mediating benefits of their tech.

In the wake of these decisions, the family enters a new rhythm where bedtime complements both empathy and innovation. Elysia introduces a hybrid approach that integrates SIT while fostering imaginative storytelling that encourages emotional reflection. Over time, Zara flourishes, finding joy in being part of a shared narrative while still enjoying lively dream excursions offered by their technology. Elysia and Kiran foster a pulsating culture of creativity and connection, navigating the complexities of modern parenting with tradition’s power coalesced in a fresh scope. As peace settles in at bedtime, they once again turn off their devices, happy to dive deep into worlds unseen, united by the compelling ‘goodnight’ lingering in the air.
