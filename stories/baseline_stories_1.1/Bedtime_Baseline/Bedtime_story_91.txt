In the year 2045, society has undergone a radical transformation when it comes to the concept of bedtime. No longer simply a time for sleep, it has become a highly regulated experience maintained by the Neural Sleep Orchestrators (NSOs). These sleek devices, implanted just above the brainstem, control the sleep-wake cycle, ensuring optimal rest and rejuvenation tailored to each individual's genetic predispositions. Mira, a dedicated sleep engineer, prides herself on her role in perfecting the digital algorithms of the NSOs. Her best friend, Lina, a rebellious artist, finds the idea of conformity stifling. Meanwhile, twin brothers Kai and Leon struggle with their respective NSOs; Kai embraces the implant while Leon resists its influence, yearning for a more organic connection to sleep and dreams.

As the story unfolds, tensions rise when a glitch in the NSOs begins to appear, causing unexpected side effects, including vivid, uncontrolled dreaming and loss of autonomy over sleep schedules. Mira, noticing these issues while monitoring the inputs and outputs from her facility, investigates the anomalies that her NSOs unleash on the citizens. She enlists Kaya, optimistic and detail-oriented, to help her dive deep into the coding of the devices. Meanwhile, Leon becomes increasingly disillusioned with the technology, leading secret midnight gatherings where he advocates for a return to natural sleep. As the brothers clash over their different beliefs—the dreamer versus the conformist—Mira feels the emotional strain of her friendships and finds herself distanced from Lina as well. 

The conflict reaches a crescendo when Leon orchestrates a citywide blackout to free people from their NSOs, urging everyone to experience real dreams without the manipulative grasp of algorithms. That night, citizens intuitively gather, each reflecting on their desires and fears as they tumble into spontaneous sleep. Mira and Kai must confront the devastating consequences of their work when they discover the blackout has spiraled out of control, causing a neurofeedback backlash that sends many citizens into traumatic dream scenarios. Amid flickering neon lights and hurried cries, Mira must race against time to reverse the effects of the blackout while navigating the complex labyrinth of emotions connected to her friendships.

As Mira activates a failsafe protocol designed for such emergencies, the city's power gradually returns, restoring the NSOs but at a significant transition point. People awaken not to the calm regularity they were conditioned for, but instead, to the raw beauty and chaos of unfiltered dreams—some abstract and vivid, others unsettling. The experience reshapes their perceptions, leading many to question the very foundations of sleep, rest, and the quality of dreams imposed by machines. With newfound awareness, Leon and Lina join forces, inspiring others to express their innermost thoughts instead of becoming passive recipients to a cohesive narrative defined by codes. 

In the aftermath of the crisis, Mira reflects on her role in the upheaval of a world she once believed was for the better. With the NSOs now upgraded by the modifications made during the blackout, they function less as monopolizing forces and more as facilitators for natural sleep, providing guidance instead of control. The once stark division between those who embraced and those who resisted technological advances begins to blur as society embraces a new philosophy of sleep. Driven by her friendship with Leon and creativity sparked in Lina, Mira finds amateur artistic expression leading her into self-discovery while planting seeds for a renaissance in the realm of dreams—a place where the human spirit can flourish amidst the slumbering conflict of technology and rebellion.
