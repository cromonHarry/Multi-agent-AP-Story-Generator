In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has transformed into a high-tech ritual governed by a global Sleep Synchronization Program (SSP). Families now connect through virtual reality chambers where they experience shared dreams, enhancing emotional bonding. Amara, a neuroscientist and the lead developer of the SSP, lives with her partner, Banks, a dream architect who creates immersive dream experiences. Their teenage daughter, Elara, often cherishes the proposed narratives designed by Banks, while her younger brother, Milo, is agentically reckless and distracted by the allure of augmented reality games that interrupt his dream-sharing. As they depend more on technology for rest, national sleep health rates soar, but questions arise regarding the authenticity of their relationships and the quality of their sleep.

As the family delves deeper into the world of stylized dreams, an unsettling glitch arises within the SSP. Dream experiences become untraceable, leading to shared nightmares that leave participants wallowing in confusion. Amara works late to fix the technological issues that plague the program, and her obsession threatens to fracture familial bonds. Elara, once enthralled by the curated dream worlds, begins noticing shadows of her friends caught in the network, unable to escape their shared nightmares. Meanwhile, Milo discovers a loophole in the SSP, enabling him to access a rogue element of the system that draws him into a darker reality—a digital black market for nightmares.

The climax ignites when Amara uncovers the source of the glitches; a rogue hacker, known only as "Drifter," infiltrates the interconnected dream network, binding the children’s nightmares to feed their fears to exploit for attention and profit. With Elara manipulated into participating in a harmful virtual dream ordeal against her will, Amara and Banks rush into the enhanced dream state to confront both the fears severing their family ties and the malevolent force wrecking the SSP. Together, they navigate a surreal battleground, encountering a series of haunting nightmares representing their greatest fears, tearing at the very seams of their interconnected lives. Their emotional vulnerabilities clash against formidable dream constructs, testing their resolve to reclaim their dreams.

In the aftermath, emotionally bruised but transformed, the family awakens to a stark realization of priorities. They come together with their shared experiences, shattered by the chaos but reconstructed by understanding and trust. Amara is determined to redesign the SSP, integrating safeguards that ensure narratives enhance relationships without overshadowing reality. Elara discovers strength and resolve to advocate for ethical storytelling within dreams. Young Milo, inspired by the thrill of conquest, shapes a new game rooted in joy instead of fear, grounding the family’s connection amidst the technological advancements. 

In the final scene, the family opts to spend time offline, savoring each other's presence under the stars, redefining their relationships as vital components of nighttime bonding. They plan to explore qualities of good sleep devoid of simulated experiences, celebrating the unfiltered journey of bedtime rituals. Purged of their previous reliance on technology and propelled by imaginative storytelling in the real world, they set the foundations for a new family mantra: dreams are best when woven into the fabric of reality, not lost to the uncertainty of the future. They embrace the power of sharing authentic moments before sleep, determined to sleep soundly beneath a blanket of genuine connections.
