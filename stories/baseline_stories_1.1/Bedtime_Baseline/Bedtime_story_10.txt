In the year 2045, the concept of “bedtime” has transformed beyond recognition. With the advent of MindRest technology, sleep is no longer a simple necessity. Society now relies on neural synchronization devices to optimize rest, allowing individuals to recharge instantly, often taking “bedtime” breaks throughout the day. However, the technology is a double-edged sword. Parents such as Lina, a sleep-tech engineer, and her husband Marcus, a writer, are increasingly concerned about their children’s relationship with sleep. Their daughter Sophie, an inquisitive teenager with a penchant for adventure, and her younger brother Max, a tech-savvy child yearning for connection, have come to view sleep merely as an annoying pause in their always-on lives, disconnected from nature and the uncertainties of real experience.

As Lina and Marcus try to guide their kids towards a healthier relationship with sleep, a radical movement emerges that vilifies MindRest as a source of societal dependency. The “Sleepers,” led by the charismatic and rebellious Theo, promote natural sleeping methods while warning of the long-term consequences of relying on technology to define an essential human experience. The allure of experiencing unfiltered dreams and the unknown calls to Sophie, who begins to feel suffocated by the regimented lifestyle imposed by the choices of her parents. Tensions escalate as Theo and Sophie grow closer, and she becomes increasingly embroiled in the movement's ideology, questioning the very fabric of her family’s accustomed reality.

Amid this emotional turmoil, a citywide blackout occurs, disrupting the neural synchronization network just as an upcoming festival celebrates innovation in sleep tech. In the resulting chaos, Lina and Marcus find themselves grappling with the sudden act of vulnerability: sleep becomes a rare luxury. As they struggle with the absence of familiar distractions, they resolve to wholeheartedly embrace this timeout, seeking an understanding of their children's evolving perspectives. Meanwhile, Sophie and Max, trapped in the outages, experience restless nights full of unadulterated dreams, leading to both fantasies and nightmares. The experience forces them to confront their fears, insecurities, and ultimately, the meaning of true rest.

As the blackout intensifies, emotions peak; Sophie and her brother argue with their parents about chosen paths and the impact of their decisions. Just as conflicts threaten to drive a wedge between them, they discover an unexpected common ground as they share stories and dreams that had been previously drowned out by screens and societal pressures. The family spends those compounded nights in dialogue — fear, love, and dreams intertwining as they reconnect and find solace in vulnerability. Theo sees an opportunity and joins forces with them, offering his insight and passion for real change. This collaboration leads to the development of an alternative, cooperative vision of sleep, one that fosters community and belonging.

Upon the restoration of power, the world renews with a collective understanding. Lina and Marcus devise an initiative that transcends the competing ideologies of night life, seamlessly merging traditional sleep with the advancements of MindRest to ensure awareness of natural routines. The family, now united through shared experiences, becomes ambassadors for this mental health-oriented approach to rest. Sophie and Max, free to express their identities, build a unique bond shaped not only by technology but also by the stories of their dreams, bridging past realities with the fast-paced future. Through cohesive family dialogue and a reinvigorated relationship to bedtime, they illuminate the redefined essence of what it means to rest in a rapidly changing world.
