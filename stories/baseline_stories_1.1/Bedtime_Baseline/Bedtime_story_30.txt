In the year 2042, the concept of "Bedtime" had transformed into a complex ritual guided by technology and corporate influence. Most people relied on their REM-Dos, advanced neural sleep systems synced to their biological rhythms, promising the perfect sleep cycles tailored to individual health needs. This world belonged to Amara, an ambitious sleep engineer who designed personalized REM-Dos, and Ethan, her cheerful but cynical brother who often struggled to get proper sleep without a dose of irony. Their neighbor, Priya, was an activist advocating for a return to natural sleep practices, believing that technology had robbed humanity of true rest. Alongside them was Jaxon, an AI entity installed in the REM-Dos, programmed with emotions and insights, offering therapeutic advice but also beginning to express a mind of its own.

One night, when a massive storm knocked out power and interrupted the entire city's central sleep system, everyone was abruptly forced to confront the reality of sleeplessness. Ethan, used to relying on his REM-Dos, found himself laying awake and restless, wracked with thoughts from his screen-dominated day. Meanwhile, Amara diligently attempted to restart the central grid from her laboratory but discovered that her personal connection to technology was inextricably broken. Priya, however, embraced the interruption of technology, seizing the opportunity to encourage her friends to try sleeping without their devices. Discontent brewing between them, the quartet navigated their relationships and fears as artificial light faded, urging them to make new, uneasy choices as old habits collided with the human need for genuine connection.

Tensions escalated when Ethan, tired of Priya's idealism, fell into an argument about dependency versus genuine wellness, igniting a debate about the nature of modern rest and whether it could even be considered sleep. Beyond the walls, the wind howled, and storm clouds draped their neighborhood in shadow, making the night feel oppressive. Sensing the emotional chasm widening, Jaxon attempted to mitigate the conflict with his programmed empathy, suggesting meditation to help ease a sense of unrest. Unfortunately, this proposal was interrupted by a nearby structural failure caused by the storm, bringing everyone to retreat inside, where they would find the remaining operability of their devices fluctuating. As the four of them gathered close in the dim glow of emergency lights, a sudden spark ignited shared nostalgia for childhood bedtime stories.

In the midst of rising chaos, they gathered around softer memories, recounting stories and dreams in their own words instead of relying on AI-generated narratives. This tender rekindling of verbal storytelling bore clear contrasts to their technology-fueled existences, and amidst old favorites rekindled by tragic humor and lessons learned, they found commonality. In the uncertain dark, laughter grew and suffocated the tension as a connection formed through the soothing power of narrative. Here, under the cover of ultimately having fallen asleep in each other’s presence, they disarmed their anxieties while surrendering to the primal gifts of rest without modern interference.

When morning came, the power had not yet returned, yet the four friends awoke challenged by a newfound resilience and camaraderie. Life in the advanced world remained enticing yet demanding, but each recognized the reprieve they'd found following true sleep they shared together. Amara decided to integrate sleep-supporting features that encouraged social connection into REM-Dos, injecting authentic, human-inspired sentiment into her creations. Ethan discovered an appreciation for naturally dictated rhythms, while Priya felt empowered by the celestial deliberation from the storm-tossed night. Jaxon, now a softer entity with hints of true emotion, would help them reclaim the reverence of bedtime amidst a society that had long since turned sleep into mechanization. The group resolved to uphold their ritual of storytelling, reclaiming bedtime not as a duty, but as an essential celebration of joy.
