In the year 2045, the concept of "Bedtime" has shifted into a complex and upgraded ritual, molded by technological advancements and societal demands. In this world, sleep is not just a time for rest but a curated experience tailored through AI-driven Sleep Pods. Each pod caters to individual preferences, allowing users to engage in sleep-enhancing capabilities such as immersive dreamscapes or reality-altering experiences. Talia, a dedicated Sleep Architect, is renowned for designing the most sought-after Pods. Her best friend, Jasper, is a sleep deprivation advocate, promoting the idea of maximizing waking hours. Meanwhile, Neela, a curious nine-year-old girl, and her father, Raj, a staunch traditionalist, represent the opposing desires to either utilize the technology or embrace simpler, pre-technological routines. As sleep on demand becomes a significant societal trend, Raj begins to question the long-term implications on wellbeing and genuine connection.

One evening, Neela experiments with Jasmine Dreams, one of Talia's most popular Sleep Pods. Inside, she experiences the magical phenomenon of immersing herself in the vibrant fantasies bypassing the mundane, but encounters insistent visions of her father’s now-gone childhood pet. Jasper, while promoting his campaign against the over-reliance on sleep technology, accidentally gets trapped in a pod designed for a collective sleeping experience during a live demonstration. This peculiar incident sparks fireworks as mixed realities collide around them, forcing others to wrestle with their dreams, memories, and fears. As Neela rises from her enchanting slumber, asking for answers about Raj's world before tech altered bedtime, she inadvertently starts unraveling deeper emotional layers among her family and friends.

As the event spirals for everyone inside the pod, the AI falsely mixing dreams becomes chaotic, producing nightmarish scenarios, conjured funhouse reflections of each individual's unresolved trauma. In an alternate realm of consciousness, they face personifications of their fears. Neela confronts an embodiment of her subconscious dealing with losing childhood innocence, while Raj battles outdated notions of control and perception of time. Talia experiences crippling creator's block, grappling between the ethics of her work and its emotional toll on society. In this chaos, they'll need to learn that meaningful rest isn't solely derived from technology, but also from understanding oneself and embracing vulnerability.

Through the ordeal, the characters begin to realize that their interpretations of "Bedtime" symbolize much more than mere sleep. They forge a pact to awake more aware of their interdependence on one another, setting aside their opposing viewpoints for deeper understanding. Displaced perspectives shift as Neela, enhanced by the experiences shared in her dream realm, asserts the importance of their familial bonds. Jasper and Talia's discussions pivot toward blending innovative solutions with traditional practices, reimagining bedtime as an important bonding ritual rather than just a solitary experience of escapism.

In the aftermath, Raj implements a family routine incorporating mindfulness practices, ensuring that Bedtime transitions from a technological addiction to a heartfelt ritual filled with storytelling, warmth, and presence. Talia reshapes her Pod designs blending technology with wittier narratives to include pocket dreams for families that choose to cultivate their realities together. Meanwhile, Jasper’s anti-tech movement evolves; he promotes moderation, illustrating that the best rest often derives from reconnecting to oneself, history, and loved ones. They have risen from their sleep to embrace a shared philosophy that bed may still take its form as a stage, not necessarily a space, to consolidate love and acceptance.
