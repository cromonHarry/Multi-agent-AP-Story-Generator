In the year 2045, society has transformed the very concept of "bedtime" into a ritual of immersive digital experiences. Once a simple end of day routine, bedtime is now governed by neurotechnology that enhances sleep through sensory simulations, allowing users to travel through vividly constructed dreamscapes while their bodies rest. Families schedule their bedtime experiences like events, choosing from a library of adventures tailored to their preferences. Aria, a single mother and sleep tech designer, often struggles to balance her hectic work life with her adolescent son Kai’s dreams of becoming a lucid artist. Their lives are intertwined with Amir, a prominent sleep researcher, and Nina, Aria's tech-savvy best friend who runs a popular sleep simulation platform. However, as more people lean on technology to enhance their sleep, an underground movement called Wakers starts emerging, advocating the importance of natural dreams and the disconnection from artificial simulations.

One evening, at a studying session for a new immersive simulation, Kai accidentally stumbles onto a forgotten set of algorithms hidden in the network. Oblivious to their power, he activates the code, creating an unprecedented dreamscape—a world that connects past desires, present fears, and unexplored potential. As Kai's unique experience begins to cloud the line between reality and dream, Aria finds herself unintentionally pulled into her son’s new realm during one of her nightly sessions. Meanwhile, Amir becomes curious about Kai’s extraordinary findings and persuades Aria to collaborate as they venture deeper into the complexities of the dream. Feeling his mother release her worry and rediscover her creativity, Kai is empowered, while Nina, concerned for her friend’s choices, insists that this could pose risks, suggesting they need to access "Wakers" as a counterpoint.

During their journey through Kai's vast dreamscape, edge-of-reality creatures and distorted representations of their fears challenge all four characters. Amir undergoes a moment of personal revelation, confronting his own fear of failure in his research, while Nina faces the tenacity of her need for control over her emotions and future. Aria relives vivid memories of her aspirations from an unfulfilled artistic life, helping her to mend her relationship with Kai, supported by the fluid trust bridge they have built during these surreal escapades. Just as they pull together towards the outer regions of the dreamscape, a surprising glitch catapults them into a shifting tangle of consciousness that reconnects them to suppressed memories and a once-cherished hope for humanity: the real experience of dreaming and authentic connection. As warnings from Wakers loom, reality start dissipating. 

The intense climax hinges on whether the group can stabilize their journey while redefining their understanding of dreams, risking the ever-growing digital overlay they relied upon. In a symbolic act of choice, Aria decides to confront their turmoil and the digital allure, allowing her instincts to lead them back through their vulnerabilities. The choice crystallizes the group’s friendship—a choice that pushes against the technological tide that threatens to engulf authenticity. They discover a way to navigate the dreamscape while curating elements from both natural and digital realms, thus crafting innovative experiences that encourage spontaneous dreams, combining their personal journeys.

At dawn, they awaken, physically and mentally renewed. The experience transforms their relationship with dreaming and bedtime, allowing them to straddle a line between technology and nature without allowing one to eclipse the other. Distrust and doubt are washed away in the recentering of their identities; Aria decides to develop a new application that allows users to personalize their sleep without losing touch with their innate dreams. Nina steps in to help by creating awareness within her platform. Amir finds inspiration for his research pursuing adaptable theories intertwining the subconscious with new methods. And as for Kai, he now strives toward becoming a refined lucid artist, stitching together threads of reality. The group embodies a revolution of mindfulness within sleep, ensuring that the future of bedtime heals.
