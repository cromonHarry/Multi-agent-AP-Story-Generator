In the year 2145, society has undergone a radical transformation in its approach to sleep. The concept of "bedtime" has shifted from a simple nightly ritual into a highly regulated process, monitored by the state through neuro-smart technology that promotes optimal cognitive function. Families are encouraged to synchronize their sleep cycles using AI-driven Sleep Harmonizers, implanted devices that analyze brainwaves to deliver tailored sleep experiences. In this landscape, we meet Lia, a young girl struggling with her daily routines, Eric, her ambitious father who prioritizes work over family time, Marisol, her nurturing mother who tries to reconnect with her daughter, and Zephyr, the AI assistant who manages their sleep schedule.

Tensions rise as Lia begins to rebel against bedtime protocols, feeling increasingly trapped by a world that tells her when to sleep. She is particularly frustrated by the relentless enforcement of "Sleep Optimization Hours," which coincide with her favorite evening activities. Eric, under immense pressure to achieve corporate goals, neglects Lia’s struggles, prioritizing her adherence to sleep schedules at the expense of their family bond. Marisol, meanwhile, senses the growing chasm between her husband and daughter. She feels drawn to breaking the rules, contemplating a 'family sleep escape' without the omnipresent Zephyr. Their internal conflicts deepen as each continues to navigate the consequences of a society that views sleep as above all an efficiency metric.

One evening, Marisol finally takes a stand and pulls Lia out of the house to embark on their own clandestine bedtime ritual—one entirely devoid of technology. They drive to an old forest, a remnant of nature from a time before sleep became commodified and controlled. As twilight descends, they prepare to camp under the stars, indulging in stories from before the "Age of Optimization." Meanwhile, Eric is thrown into a frenzy upon realizing Marisol and Lia have disappeared, and he hurries to locate them, torn between his parental responsibilities and corporate expectations. In this moment of isolation, Lia feels freer than ever, her imagination ignited by the vastness of the night sky, but unresolved tension lingers as she thinks of her father.

The climax reaches its peak when Eric discovers Marisol and Lia at their makeshift camp and, faced with the chaos of emotions, confronts his daughter. Instead of reprimanding her, he begins to comprehend the necessity of balance between work and family, realizing that their investment in sleep should extend to their need for connection. As father and daughter argue passionately in the frost of the night air, a malfunction in Zephyr's system resonates through their devices, triggering alarming notifications highlighting the risks of unpredictable sleep patterns. It serves as a reminder that life cannot truly be calculated into neat metrics, and for the first time in a long time, Eric contemplates what genuine rest and love mean.

In the aftermath, the family’s relationships begin to mend as they return home, cherishing their newfound understanding. Eric implements boundaries at work to prioritize family time, gradually allowing a rekindling of joy during the hours before sleep. Marisol and Lia, inspired by their adventure, advocate for a reformed approach to bedtime within their community, emphasizing creativity, spontaneity, and connection rather than strict adherence to routines. Ultimately, the once highly regulated “Bedtime” evolves into a cherished family practice, weaving together restorative sleep and meaningful nightlives, fostering a world where connection overshadows efficiency, and cultivating evenings of laughter beneath the stars.
