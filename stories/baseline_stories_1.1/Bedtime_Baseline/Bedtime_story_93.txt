In the year 2045, bedtime has transformed dramatically in response to an all-encompassing digital culture and new tech. The concept of sleep has been supplanted by an advanced Neural Relaxation Protocol (NRP) that allows citizens to upload their consciousness into a shared dreamscape called "Reveria." Here, dreams can be engineered, traded, and even purchased, creating a lucrative economy around bedtime experiences. Four friends navigate this new reality: Imani, an idealistic journalist seeking the truth behind NRP's origins; Leo, a skeptical former coder who once worked on early iterations of the protocol; Mira, an artist who creates stunning dreamscapes for clients; and Haruto, a brilliant but reclusive tech designer obsessed with enhancing human consciousness. Together, they begin to unravel the implications of a world where dreaming is become commercialized, and true sleep is a fading memory.

Imani senses something darker beneath Reveria’s gleaming surface and aligns herself with Leo, who harbors deep misconceptions about how NRP has changed humanity. Their pursuit leads them to Mira, who initially relishes in her dreamscaping work but is frightened by the emotional toll it extracts from her creations. The group later seeks Haruto, who is rumored to be secretly developing a version of NRP that could bypass the need for sleep altogether. As they delve deeper into their investigation, they uncover unsettling stories of people losing their ability to dream naturally, relying instead on fabricated dreams that feel increasingly hollow. Tensions rise as these friends debate the ethics of artificial dreaming, the nature of consciousness, and what it means to truly rest.

The stakes escalate when they learn about a blackout event, an unintended consequence of fluctuating network powers. In this crisis, users across the globe unexpected wake up trapped between sleep and wakefulness. While Imani and Leo strive to document the chaos, Mira rages against her fading creativity fueled by corporate interests that strip emotions from her art. Haruto wrestles with guilt grounding from his role in building what now feels like a dystopian prison. Facing an imminent loss of their escape from reality, they make the daring decision to secretly penetrate Reveria’s core server, hoping to install a code fix that restores authenticity to dreams.

Their infiltration leads them into a virtual maze where they confront manifestations of their inner fears and desires. As Imani battles a nightmare of losing independent thought to corporate dominance, Leo struggles with feelings of inadequacy from his previous role in inception and development, while Mira faces representations of her art twisted into grotesque parodies of delight due to consumerism. Haruto, instead of aligning with technology, finds inner strength, confronting the moral compromise embedded in his innovations. The group fights their way through their personal traumas, believing that if they succeed in rewriting the protocol, they can revive meaningful dreams and genuine rest for everyone.

Emerging from the digital shadows, they finally breach the heartbeat of the NRP system. With a final act of united will, they install the new code just before the blackout fully seizes control. Awakening in the real world, where sleep may become an option for the first time in years, the friends experience genuine dawn together. Their collective trauma has transformed into a layered strength that interweaves their friendships with the beauty of possibility. Even as they ponder a world revitalized by real dreams, Imani's determined pen and Leo's skeptical mind forge a new infographic banner highlighting the virtues of balance between technology and humanity, aiming to rekindle a culture that values true rest and authentic connection.
