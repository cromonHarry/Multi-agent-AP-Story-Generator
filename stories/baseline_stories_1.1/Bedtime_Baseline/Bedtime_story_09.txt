In the year 2045, the concept of “Bedtime” has radically transformed in response to society's relentless pursuit of productivity and technological advancement. In the sprawling metropolis of New Neos, nestled among skyscrapers laden with digital billboards and virtual reality centers, sleep has become a luxury—a mere palliative managed by a cutting-edge technology known as the Somnus Device. This device offers users the ability to control the duration and quality of their sleep, alongside immersive dreams designed for entertainment or relaxation. The inhabitants rarely experience actual bedtime rituals, and those who do are considered nostalgic at best. Among them are four friends: Alice, a sleep scientist curious about natural slumber; Jonah, a virtual reality artist who has perfected dreamscapes; Mira, a rebellious journalist investigating the societal implications of sleep technology; and Rob, a corporate technocrat advocating for the widespread adoption of the Somnus Device.

As the friends navigate their lives, a dissonance emerges within their group regarding the future of sleep. Mira’s exploration into the addictive nature of the Somnus Device leads her to uncover disturbing data showing increasing rates of mental health issues correlated with extended use. Fueled by a desire to reclaim the beauty of sleep, she confronts Rob, who is oblivious to the dangers of the device, caught up in sales pitches and bright visions of productivity. The camaraderie of the group hangs in the balance as Mira’s investigation digs deeper, revealing that some users have been waking up without any recollection of their dreams or their real lives, leading to existential crises. As pressure mounts, Alice decides to experiment with a back-to-basics approach, urging the group to reconnect with their primal need for natural sleep without technology. Sensing potential conflict brewing among different ideologies within their circle, she suggests a weekend retreat in a remote area, away from the intrusive tech.

The weekend arrives, fraught with tension. When they settle into their chosen cabin, Jonah proposes to recreate dreamscapes without technology, suggesting they share their deepest fears and fantasies around a campfire each night. That evening, as the friends unwind, the discussions lead to profound revelations. Mira’s authentic fear of losing herself traps her in a cycle of manufactured happiness, while Rob begins to recognize his reluctance to face the concept of mortality and imperfect human experience, a reality he has so far bypassed with advancements. Despite their new understanding, the conflict peaks when Mira unearths a chilling truth—the Somnus Device's parent company is set to release an upgrade that threatens to eliminate night sleep entirely, creating a 24/7 work paradigm. Realizing the ramifications, Mira urges them to act fast, propelling the group into action.

As the moment of confrontation draws near, the emotional brawl culminates in a desperate decision. Rob, in a moment of desperation after facing the prospect of losing his friends to the backlash of their revelations, betrays Mira by leaking details about her investigation to the company. The betrayal leaves Mira shattered, but she refuses to back down. In a daring move, she harnesses the power of Jonah's VR artistry to create a public presentation that juxtaposes the haunting consequences of altered sleep with the idyllic beauty of natural restfulness, aimed at awakening the populace to their required humanity. Their combined strengths forge a connection between audiences so profound it forces the company to rethink their approach to bedtimes altogether.

With newfound resolve and a changed perspective on life, the friends reconcile as the fire of awareness ignites across New Neos. While Rob confronts his motives and seeks redemption, Mira inspires a movement that integrates both technological and natural sleep practices, creating better tools for mental well-being. The once-ominous world of bedtime begins to shift once more, blending nostalgic rituals with innovative advancements, allowing individuals to embrace sleep not as a commodity, but as an essential cycle of life. In the embrace of natural dreams, the four friends find that they are not just reclaiming bedtime; they are rediscovering themselves, healing their futures while reweaving timeless human connections.
