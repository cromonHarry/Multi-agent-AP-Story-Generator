In the year 2050, the world has advanced into an era where sleep has been redefined by technology. Children and adults alike rely on SleepSynths—neural interfaces that deliver curated dreams and optimal sleep cycles. No longer do individuals need to spend hours in bed; SleepSynths allow for efficiently compressed sleep time, leaving humans with more waking hours to chase ambition, creativity, or distraction. The protagonist, Mira, a 12-year-old girl, struggles with the idea of “real” dreams versus the artificial ones delivered by her SleepSynth. Her childhood friends, Leo and Junie, seem content to enjoy their pre-packaged nocturnal experiences, but Mira feels increasingly alienated by her dependence on the device. In contrast, their older brother, Kane, an engineer behind SleepSynths, espouses the benefits of these devices—at the same time, he harbors doubts and longs for a simpler time.

One evening, amid increasing pressure at school and family commitments, Mira discovers a hack that allows her to bypass the artificial dreams generated by her SleepSynth. Encouraged and anxious, she beams with excitement at finding a way to unlock the traditional realm of dreams, shared with her friends over lush conversations about their wildest fantasies. However, when Mira tries her hack, she accidentally unleashes a unique experience: a merger of reality and dream that taps into a deeper consciousness rife with both beauty and fear. Throughout the night, strange, vivid visuals start to emerge and intertwine with memories from her childhood, particularly one about her cherished grandmother, who often told her stories before bed. As the lines begin to blur between the past and the surreal, Mira finds herself on a quest to uncover the boundaries of this newfound power.

Mira’s journey leads her through a labyrinth of dreams, presenting her with characters and challenges drawn from her deepest fears and desires. She navigates a snowy forest where her deceased grandmother stands as a mystical guide, encouraging her to accept responsibility for her emotions and memories—something she never did as a child. Meanwhile, Leo and Junie, drawn into Mira’s chaos, plunge into her dreamscape out of concern. As Mira forces the dream to unfold in her favor, the turmoil and wonder clash violently, igniting an internal conflict that soon manifests outside her control. In a climactic confrontation with the experience's darkness—a shadowy figure formed from her deepest insecurities—the trio must rally together to support Mira through the tumult.

As the surreal clashes subside, Mira, bolstered by the love of her friends, learns to wield the strange powers of her newfound ability. The trio confronts her fears head-on, culminating in a moment of vulnerability as Mira resolves to embrace both the realities of her insecurities and the vibrant fabric of her dreams. Through this confrontation, Mira not only reshapes her understanding of bedtime and its importance but also sets Leo and Junie on a path of empathy, teaching them the value of authentic experiences versus synthetic shortcuts.

Emerging from her dreamscape with newfound awareness, Mira opts to keep her SleepSynth but alters its settings. She introduces the idea of "reflection patches," where nights would be spent either journeying through pure experiences or revisiting cherished memories with her friends by her side. In this new era of bedtime, the exploration of dreams becomes a sacred space accomplished with real connection, laughter, and storytelling. Together, they stand with Kane, who learns to appreciate the traditional elements of sleep. With a blend of modernity and nostalgia, the essence of bedtime transforms into a ritual—one that honors the past, embraces the present, and inspires futures woven together by shared dreams.
