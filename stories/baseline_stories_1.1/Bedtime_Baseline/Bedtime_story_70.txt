In the year 2042, society has transformed the concept of "bedtime" into an intricate, technocratic ritual. Many families have abandoned traditional sleep for a virtual sleep experience facilitated by neural implants. These devices sync brainwaves with curated dreamscapes, allowing users to engage in tailored narratives that improve mental wellness and creativity during their nightly rest. Sumira, a sleep engineer, perfects dream algorithms that maximize the benefits of this new sleep method. Her younger brother, Caleb, a rebellious teenager, resents the synthetic nature of sleep and yearns for the authenticity of real dreams. Meanwhile, their mother, Lila, is a devoted advocate of the immersive sleep trends, while their father, Elliot, wrestles with the fear that technology has replaced genuine human connection.

As Sumira prepares to introduce a revolutionary sleep program that promises to make dreams even more vivid and fulfilling, Caleb rebels against the family’s reliance on technology. He believes the true essence of dreaming is being lost. At the same time, Lila's advocacy grows when she organizes a community event to showcase the latest bedtime innovations. She wholeheartedly supports Sumira’s work, fondly imagining a brighter future where her children don’t just sleep but thrive in imaginative worlds. Caleb's frustrations reach a boiling point, leading him to sneak away to a forbidden underground community known as the Sleepers, who embrace natural, unenhanced dreaming. This divergence in beliefs creates tension and divisions within the family, as Elliot, caught between his wife and children, falters in his once firm belief in technology.

The family’s conflict comes to a head when Sumira launches her new sleep program at the community event, specifically designed to integrate a shared dream experience that would unite families closer than ever before. Caleb, having recently experienced a jarring encounter with the Sleepers, decides to expose the risks of their technological dependance during the event. He hacks into the program, exploiting its vulnerabilities to expose its potential for addiction and loss of real-world connections. The demonstration spirals out of control, plunging attendees into a chaotic shared nightmare. This moment serves as a grand revelation for all present, showcasing how a life reduced to engineered experiences can become toxic.

As the tumult settles, the family—having navigated the chaos of realizing their starkly different perspectives—comes together once more. Sumira understands the pressing need to balance technology with authenticity, while Caleb learns to see the potential in innovations that enhance life rather than detract from it. In a moment of reparative bonding, Lila finds common ground in her love for her family rather than her allegiance to technologically-based beliefs. Elliot steps forward as a mediator, pushing for a compromise that allows for both organic and enhanced dreaming experiences.

In the aftermath of the chaos, the family works to create an updated bedtime ritual that transcends either extreme. They encourage organic dreaming practices alongside the newfound virtues of curated dream technology. Families in the community begin to reconnect with each other, embracing both aspects of sleep as new bedtime practices emerge. Transitioning away from dependency, the core of “bedtime” evolves—no longer a singular act, but a rich blend of imagination, shared experiences, and connections that honor both the past and future. With renewed perspective, Sumira, Caleb, Lila, and Elliot find solace in their shared nightly gathering, from reading stories aloud to savoring dreams in all their authentic forms.
