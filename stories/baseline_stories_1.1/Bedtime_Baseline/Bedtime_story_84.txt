In the year 2065, the world has become a place where sleep is a treasured commodity monitored and optimized by advanced technology. Miri, a cognitive scientist specializing in sleep research, is one of the last human “Sleep Theraps,” professionals who help restore proper bedtime habits to those addicted to the ubiquitous dream pods. Alongside her tech-savvy but emotionally aloof partner, Dex, who works for the largest sleep optimization corporation, SleepWell Dynamics, Miri’s job has never been more critical. They live in the suburban utopia of Neo Haven, where children like ten-year-old Aiden attend a school where sleep is quantified like currency, but relationships have been replaced by VR sleep companions. Juno, Miri's spirited teenage niece, struggles against a society that romanticizes artificial dreams over personal connection, participating in underground groups that encourage ‘real-sleep’ sessions—actual rest without tech interference.

As bedtime routines have become an elaborate affair involving sleep education through AI tutors, light-harvesting nanofabric, and customized dream narratives, Miri begins to notice alarming trends in her adult patients, whose data shows rising levels of anxiety and insomnia despite technological advancements. Unsettled by the implications of an entire generation unwilling to risk disconnectedness for mere comfort in sleep, she pushes for a public broadcast demonstration of “natural sleep,” using skills honed from years of hands-on practice. Miri plans to gather people from the community, including her struggling niece Juno, to engage in the experience sustainably while promoting the benefits of organic rest and authentic dreams over the artificial crutches the world has become dependent on.

Underestimate and sabotage become evident. The night of the demonstration approaches, and with it comes a series of complications—Dex's supervisors at SleepWell Dynamics discover her plans and decide to crack down on the public demonstration, seeing it as a mortal threat to their product-based dream-structure. Furthermore, Aiden, curious about the impending event, inadvertently becomes enmeshed in a conspiracy when he stumbles upon experimenting parents who have devised sinister ways to keep their children from sleeping naturally, engaging in tech-fueled manipulation, transforming natural sleep into a point of power instead. As Miri and Aiden’s bond deepens through open conversations about their experiences, they realize that they must act quickly to resist the impending standardization of sleep.

The climax occurs as Miri, Juno, and Aiden take refuge in the local expansive botanical garden during the demonstration. They panic as Dex arrives, ready to shut down their plans at the command of the corporation but ultimately find themselves drawn into an unexpected conversation. In a moment of shared revelation, Aiden takes a brave stand, revealing how his peers value artificial dreams—yet they yearn for a sense of reality. With each revelation, Dex begins to see the damage the corporation's manipulation has wrought on their lives, waffling between company loyalty and newfound kinship. Swept away by authenticity, Dex feels compelled to help.

In the aftermath of the confrontation, a small but mighty rebellion begins to percolate through Neo Haven, led by Miri, Juno, Aiden, and a newly repentant Dex. They rally a community that sees the power in vulnerability, heralding the dawn of a new approach to bedtime: one that encourages organic sleep practices without fully rejecting technology, allowing for a blend of harmony and necessity. Getting back to a natural sleep pattern becomes part of a broader rebellion against data commodification of consciousness, helping society rediscover a balance between artificial enhancers and human connection on a day-to-day basis. Miri’s mission evolves, fostering true well-being and advocacy for sleep health, ultimately learning that calming rest is crucial not just for dreams—but for restoring the deepest human bonds.
