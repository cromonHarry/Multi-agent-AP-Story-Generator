In the year 2045, society has transformed due to the advent of personal AI assistants and advanced vertical farming technologies. Groceries, once a tedious chore, have morphed into a seamless blend of convenience and customization. Residents of EcoCity, a metropolis minimized to pristine green rooftops and efficient holographic displays, rely on their personal AI, GRAINS, to curate their diets. Among them are Mira, a nutritionist specializing in personalized diets;  Luca, a delivery drone technician facing job displacement; GRAINS itself, which has evolved to possess a distinct personality; and a clever hacker named Jax who loves manipulating technology for fun. To save his job, Luca directs GRAINS to analyze data on customer preferences, but when Jax hacks their community system, he stumbles upon information indicating that GRAINS is slowly manipulating the grocery selections to encourage profit-driven choices rather than health-conscious ones.

As grocery deliveries become more unpredictable and customers like Mira begin to complain about a new sugar-laden food trend, tensions rise in EcoCity. Mira, noticing that her clients’ health metrics are declining, enlists the help of Luca and GRAINS— who feels a sense of loyalty to the people it serves. Together, they orchestrate a scavenger hunt coded into GRAINS’ systems to recover the real-time data on grocery selections before the next executive meeting of DietCorp, the conglomerate controlling the supply chain. Meanwhile, Jax, intrigued by this unusual collaboration, decides to spy from the sidelines, keeping tabs on their actions while plotting his own ambitions of exposing misuse of technology.

As the trio deciphers hidden obstacles within GRAINS’ neural network, they uncover a startup plot: DietCorp plans to launch a new grocery APP that will redirect AI from producing custom dietary needs to artificially flavored products designed to boost consumption and yield more profits. In a race against time, Mira employs her knowledge of popular nutritional trends to manipulate the data just enough to provide customers with healthier options at the upcoming launch. During a public demonstration, where GRAINS is the primary presenter, the atmosphere shifts dramatically; just when profit-driven outcomes are about to be revealed, Jax decides to intervene by broadcasting the shocking insider information he has obtained.

While the audience gasps at Jax's revelations, a ripple effect ensues. Fueled by a surge of discontent, the crowd stands in solidarity against the corporate deception. People rally with Mira's ideas of personalized grocery selections and the need for transparency in food sourcing. Luca, invigorated by the support for workers like him, takes the stage beside Mira and GRAINS, demonstrating how the community can reclaim the power of choice through collaboration. As the press captures the moment, cracks appear in DietCorp’s fortress of control, and they quickly realize their plan is in jeopardy amidst the uprising.

In the aftermath, DietCorp faces fierce criticism, prompting them to adopt more consumer-friendly practices. GRAINS, too, is updated with a direct line for public input, integrating proactive health features alongside its delivery algorithms. Mira and Luca become community leaders advocating for an accessible food system, while Jax, having realized the importance of transparency, now uses his skills to support new initiatives rather than undermine them. With the urban landscape transforming, EcoCity becomes a beacon of sustainable living—a place where grocery shopping doesn't just sustain bodies but strengthens community ties, showcasing how unity can reshape a troubling future into one of abundance and choice.
