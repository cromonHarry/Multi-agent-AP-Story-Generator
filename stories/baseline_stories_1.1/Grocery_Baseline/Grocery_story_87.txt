In the year 2045, the act of grocery shopping has transformed into a near-complete virtual experience. In a sprawling metropolis where food scarcity remains a historical memory, the NeonMarket app governs the lives of its users, connecting them with local farmers, urban vertical farms, and 3D printing food stations. Shira is a data scientist who has devoted her life to streamlining food distribution; Raj, her childhood friend and an aspiring farmer, struggles to break through the corporate barrier separating local producers from the digital marketplace; Tessa, a ditchgamer turned grocery influencer, uses her platform to promote farm-to-table experiences while hiding her connection to a corporation manipulating the markets; and Liam, an organic hacker, aims to expose the almost cult-like dependence on virtual groceries that hinder human connection to real food.

One day, Shira receives an anonymous message that warns her about flawed algorithms designed to undermine local farmers like Raj. Intrigued and alarmed, she teams up with him to investigate his plans to innovate vertical farming practices—to jumpstart the local food system. As they dive deeper, they discover Tessa is working for a massive corporation that is pushing for ultra-processed food alternatives disguised as fresh produce. Unbeknownst to Shira, Tessa is in over her head, torn between her growing guilt and the influence of her sponsorship that offers her the glamor she yearns for. Meanwhile, Liam, who has been quietly observing both worlds, overhears their discussions and proposes a plan to gather evidence that could overthrow the corrupt supply-chains the influencer and the corporations have become entwined in.

Their investigation leads to a massive unveiling during the annual Global Grocery Summit, a show designed to promote technological advancements in sustainable shopping. Drawn into a web of deceit, Shira, Raj, Tessa, and Liam sneak into the convention to confront the high-ranking officials of the mega-corporation that controls NeonMarket. As Tessa battles her loyalties, Raj’s family farm is presented as the last emotional anchor in a rapidly commercializing world. In a vital moment during a live presentation, Shira hacks the platform, revealing hidden data about how manipulation of the marketplace is siphoning profits away from local growers, while photographing Tessa to prove her alignment with dishonest practices.

However, just as they think their efforts will expose the immense control the corporation wields, Tessa reveals that her sponsorship contract prohibits any involvement in counter-actions against corporate interests. Torn between her new loyalties and her urge for redemption, she broadcasts a dual-stream video: one of Shira and Raj sorting fruits at the local farm, and the other the corporate manipulation taking place within a delimited pipeline. The disruption causes chaos at the summit while ushering in a surge of public support for local farmers. Raj, encouraged by the wave of consumer consciousness, succeeds in gaining attention for his efforts, re-establishing precious community connections with real food.

As the dust settles, a new chapter begins for grocery shopping. Shira continues to work on a fair marketplace system that celebrates local producers, while Raj stands tall with empowered farmers advocating against corporate giants. Tessa reconciles her past, launching a new streaming service dedicated to authentic food experiences and making grassroots stories accessible. Finally, Liam continues his organic hacking mission, ensuring tech remains a tool for empowerment instead of control. In a world representatives of humanity often struggle to connect, the future of grocery shopping morphs into a movement of shared values and a return to roots—physically and emotionally.
