Riven ingeniously constructs a towering sculpture from the queued biowaste, serving as a canvas for participatory art, while Junaim draws in the crowd, inviting them to narrate their own histories, quintessentially weaving connection through art, sustainability, and shared responsibility.

With the festival's momentum gaining intensity, Aria, Kiran, Riven, and Junaim embark on the final phase of their collective experience.
