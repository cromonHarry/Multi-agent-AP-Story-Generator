As tensions rise in Verdantia, a new government initiative proposes to heavily tax the use of biocomposites, claiming it will fund public projects but risking the core tenets of Reparative Living.

A dynamic installation from Elysia captures the crowd’s emotions, sparking a wave of empathy as Reed weaves stories of transformation from waste, emboldening the underrepresented voices to speak out. However, when a faction advocating for elite interests sabotages the event, chaos ensues.
