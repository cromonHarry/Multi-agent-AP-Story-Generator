The atmosphere buzzes with the voices of Sage North, who passionately advocates for community governance, igniting a vision of collective ecological transformation through their shared love of coffee.

As the immersive coffee ceremony unfolds, an unexpected glitch in the AR system disrupts the experience, throwing the patrons into disarray. Shadows of past ecological crises materialize, showcasing the stark reality of coffee farming struggles that many would prefer to ignore. Irene, seeking to restore calm, rallies the participants to share their own stories of connection to the land and the planet, fostering a sense of urgency and empathy. Meanwhile, Kiari rushes to integrate her sustainable farming techniques into the session, while Adan grapples with the ethical implications of his nootropic brews, realizing that his technology may have contributed to the disconnection they now face.

The tension heightens as the characters must confront their own roles in this interconnected web of ecological responsibility and advocacy.

As the immersive coffee ceremony spirals into chaos due to the AR glitch, a palpable tension fills the Solar Grove Café. Irene, rallying the disoriented patrons, calls for them to reclaim their agency, igniting a discussion on ecological resilience and personal accountability. Kiari deploys her latest eco-tech innovations to enhance the experience, weaving tales of triumph and sorrow from farmers into the fabric of the glitch, urging patrons to confront their ecological realities. Adan, haunted by his technological contributions, proposes a 'neural feedback loop', allowing participants to reshape their experiences and heal past traumas, while Sage announces a community summit, emphasizing collective action over despair. This collaboration forms a new narrative around coffee as a conduit for change, galvanizing the patrons into a unified front against ecological apathy and inspiring a deeper connection to both their beverages and the land that nurtures them.
