As she crafts her latest AR coffee sculpture, she envisions a shared narrative that breaks the societal divisions created by elite joy bots like Theo Zhiv, whose AI-farmed products dominate the market, leaving traditional coffee farmers like Asha Kamble struggling to reclaim their heritage. Meanwhile, Juno Caelum attends a decentralized collective meeting, his mind racing with ethical concerns over the cognitive manipulation embedded in these new coffee experiences, drawing him deeper into the web of societal transformation.

As Kira debuts her latest AR coffee sculpture at a popular café, she integrates the historical struggles of Asha's community into the immersive experience, drawing attention to the plight of traditional coffee farmers versus elite joy bots.
