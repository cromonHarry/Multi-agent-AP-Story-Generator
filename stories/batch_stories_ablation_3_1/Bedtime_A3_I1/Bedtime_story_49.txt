In the heart of New Elysium, the pivotal Dream Reclamation Workshop reaches a fever pitch as Kira, Dex, Gabriel, and Mira unite to confront the Sleep Cyphers head-on. Amidst a whirlwind of colors and psychedelic dream constructs, they stage an audacious infiltration of the Cyphers' central Sync Sphere, aiming to expose their manipulations live to the community. As they weave their own shared dreamscape, the four fight against the creeping tendrils of the Cypher's influence, their emotional connections empowering them to fend off an intrusion meant to distort their cohesive narrative.
