In the year 2143, the bustling eco-hub of Verdant Vale stands as a beacon of the Ecological Dental Renaissance, where oral health and environmentalism converge. Dr. Aria Luminous, a dedicated wellness architect, paces through the vibrant vertical bio-dental farm, guiding community members as they engage in their shared health rituals. Nearby, Jasper Greenhill brings joy to the vibrant space with his interactive bio-art pieces, encouraging residents to share their oral health journeys.

Consequently, a faction of residents questions Dr. Aria Luminous's approach, sparking debates about individual vs. communal health responsibility. To mend the growing divide, Luminous organizes a series of collaborative workshops, inviting everyone to contribute their stories and voices, all while SANGA helps facilitate emotional exchanges through real-time holographic media, striving to rekindle a sense of unity in their ecological mission.
