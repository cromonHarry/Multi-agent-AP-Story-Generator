In the year 2147, the city of Neolith is a dazzling battleground for ideals, where the pristine smiles of the Augmenters gleam in stark contrast to the natural grins of the 'Naturals.' Elara Vyn passionately advocates for authenticity amidst a growing wave of augmentation, rallying fellow Naturals in a vibrant protest outside a bioware clinic. Meanwhile, Dr. Voss Arkin secretly questions the morality of his creations while pushing the boundaries of dental technology, as he watches eager clients flock inside. Kai Nox, the influential leader of the Augmenters, contemplates his rising power, feeling the weight of guilt for perpetuating the divide, while journalist Anya Verid, a former member of the Neglected, prepares to expose the harsh realities behind the glittering veneers. As tensions rise, the atmosphere crackles with a fight for identity and systemic equity.

As protests grow louder, Elara organizes a coordinated strike against a popular bioware clinic, drawing attention from media and the disenfranchised Neglected. Dr. Arkin finds himself torn between his ambitions and the unsettling realization that his work supports an unethical hierarchy, leading him to secretly meet with Elara, hoping to understand her perspective. Meanwhile, Kai Nox faces backlash from some Augmenters, demanding more radical changes in societal attitudes towards authenticity. Anya investigates the motivations behind dental enhancements, unearthing disturbing truths about corporate exploitation and the Neglected. Tension escalates as overlapping pressures force alliances and ethical dilemmas to the forefront, igniting a volatile confrontation that will test their convictions.

In a heated confrontation at the grand unveiling of the latest bioware dental creation, Elara and Anya lead a dramatic protest that disrupts the event, wielding slogans that question the ethics of enhancement. As the crowd erupts in chaos, Dr. Arkin steps forward, confessing publicly that he has misgivings about the implications of his work. The facade shatters as Kai Nox, caught between his vision of liberation and the harsh realities of his actions, wrestles with his guilt and joins Elara's call for reform. Just then, the Neglected arrive, demanding their rights, forcing a united stand against the oppressive caste system, culminating in a powerful moment of solidarity that echoes deep societal change, as smiles of every kind shine defiantly together.

In the aftermath of the climactic protest, the streets of Neolith pulse with a renewed energy as Elara, Anya, and Kai forge an unprecedented coalition, bridging the chasm between Naturals, Augmenters, and the Neglected. In the glow of the bioluminescent sanctuaries, they share personal testimonies that challenge the rigid caste system, encouraging a massive shift in public sentiment toward inclusivity. Dr. Arkin, now a reluctant ally, proposes ethical reforms for dental augmentation, sparking debates in ethical tribunals. As their united voices resonate across the city, a burgeoning movement for authenticity expands, igniting a transformation in societal values and redefining the meaning of self-worth beyond appearances.

In the resolution, Neolith evolves, embracing a newfound understanding of beauty and identity as Elara, Anya, and Kai lead educational initiatives promoting both natural appearance and ethical augmentation. Dr. Arkin spearheads the establishment of a regulatory body within dental institutions to ensure equitable access to bioware technology, while openly advocating for the rights of the Neglected. Sympathetic to diverse perspectives, even former Augmenters begin to question their choices. As the vibrant streets hum with celebrations of diversity, personal stories unfold, and a festival celebrating authenticity bridges gaps between the classes. The city's skyline glows with bioluminescent art reflecting this transformative journey toward acceptance and understanding, marking a collective step toward a more inclusive future.
