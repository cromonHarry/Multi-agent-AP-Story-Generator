Just beyond the neon-lit surface, Juno Albright operates within the shadowy black market, crafting unique smiles that celebrate individuality, igniting the fire of rebellion against a cosmetic dental elite bent on controlling identity. This societal divide accelerates as grassroots movements like Elara's mobilize to challenge the allure of synthetic perfection, asserting the value of genuine expressions in a rapidly evolving world.
