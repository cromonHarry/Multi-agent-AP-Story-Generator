It has been in the air since the beginning of recorded time. People have been in a constant state of being high. Until now. Specialised gas masks are handed out and people have begun to act strange.\n\nStory:\nWhen Tyler entered the ward, his daughter Valerie was already fast asleep, her frail body no match for the potent cocktail of drugs coursing through her veins. “She’s been drifting all day, so you didn’t miss much, ” said Roni as she got up to embrace her husband. “How did the appeal go? ” Tyler smiled mournfully. “No luck there. They acknowledged my potential as a Donner, but I failed the psych evaluation again. ‘ Likely to succumb to pressures from family situation’, they said. No matter, we’ll find another way to get the money we need for Valerie’s treatments.” Tyler and Roni sat quietly as they cast furtive glances at Valerie, each lost in their own thoughts. Roni was the first to break the silence. “Did they say which project you would have been assigned to if you became a Donner? ” “They did, in fact. There’s an opening on the Renewable Energies team. They think they’re on the verge of a breakthrough, and one additional Donner is all they need to beat the Chinese competitors to the patenting deadline.” Tyler sighed, then leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes before continuing, “The hazard pay was really good too. 5 years’salary for just one month of being a Donner! And full psych after-care thrown in as well! ” Roni’s grip on Tyler’s hand tightened then. “Have the suicide rates… decreased with the psych after-care? ” “That’s what they claim, at least. Some still believe that the utter desolation one experiences with the absence of Perogon-X2 is irreversible, but hey, if that’s the price for increased mental faculties, up to a 100-point increase in IQ, there’ll always be people willing to pay.” Roni fished out a print-out from her handbag, and passed it over to Tyler. “This other group believes that Perogon-X2 is a good rather than bad thing. This ‘ naturally-occurring high’, as they call it, is the only thing keeping us from falling into a spiralling abyss of depression ... it’s the proverbial wool over our eyes, but for our own good.” “You and I are both scientists, ” laughed Tyler, “but you remember how we both thought that this surely was proof of some higher power too when the discovery was first publicised? Two birds with one stone! It keeps the majority of us merrily alive, while also ensuring that we would not run about unlocking the secrets of the universe until we were ready? ” There was no denying the contributions Donners had made to humankind. Tyler casually glanced around the room and out the window, and easily counted a dozen inventions which could not have been possible without the Donners. The hovercars, the bacterial foods with customizable tastes, implantable microchips for constant connection to the internet… even the drugs which commuted what would have been a death sentence for Valerie a decade ago to a mere ( if expensive ) annoyance. In a way, Tyler felt relief from having failed to qualify as a Donner. He had seen first-hand how some of the most emotionally-staunch people had been reduced to forlorn desolate souls once the Perogon-X2 was filtered out with the Masks. The degenerative process was universal – Donners would immediately benefit from heightened intelligence, but over time, they would latch onto and stubbornly nurse the perception that life was utterly… meaningless. Even if Donners were subsequently re-exposed to Perogon-X2, only 2 in 10 ever adapted back to normal life. The rest… preferred to simply put an end to it all. Roni’s voice snapped Tyler out of his reverie. “Tyler, remember how I begged you not to apply to be a Donner? ” “Yes, I remember.” “And you told me that you had no choice, because Valerie meant the world to you, and this was the least you could do as a parent for her? ” “Why are you bringing that up now? ” said Tyler with a flash of irritation. “I told you, I’ve been rejected. I can’t be a Donner anymore. We’ll just have to find another way.” Roni reached back into her handbag, and passed over a crisply-folded letter on embossed paper. Tyler began reading, and while he remained expressionless, Roni noted the bulging vein in the middle of his forehead, Tyler’s tell-tale indication of agitation. Roni wondered how much resistance Tyler was going to muster, but in her heart, she knew what she had to do. “I applied as well, Tyler, and they accepted me. They’ve already fitted my Mask, and I’ll be Donning it next Monday. We’ll have enough for Valerie after all.” -- - \/r\/rarelyfunny","output":"Relevance: 4.7\nCoherence: 4.7\nEmpathy: 4.0\nSurprise: 4.3\nEngagement: 4.0\nComplexity: 4.3"}

With every ounce of it I love you. What makes you ask ?” She says. Dieter shrugs gently, shifting in her arms. “I was just thinking. It 's been nearly four years since I came here and still ... Malvina, what am I ?” The queen tightens the embrace on her lover, tucking her chin on Dieter 's shoulder. A slight frown, one tinged with melancholy crosses her face. “You are a good man, and a loving one. One who I have never deserved. Your love is the greatest thing in my life. You are kind, selfless, honest and strong. That is what you are .” Queen Malvina answers. A look of rueful sadness crosses his face as he speaks. “What I mean ,” he says softly as he kisses her fingertips, sending fluttering waves through her. “is what am I here? Mordnacht says that I am a slave. Am I ?” Queen Malvina 's stomach drops as he treads upon the exact question she feared. “Mordnacht says a great deal of things. I would n't worry about what she has to say. That creature 's mind is half addled by time and the other half is full of schemes and plans. She wraps truth in lies and lies in facts. Her promises are worth their weight in gold, that is to say, nothing. Whatever she says, you must take with a grain of salt. You understand, Dieter ?” Dieter frowns at what his love says. Eyes hurt at her obvious dodging of his question. “Of course, but that does n't change what she said and which you did n't answer. Malvina, am I your slave ?” He presses. Queen Malvina 's embrace tightens slightly as pain crosses her face. “You are what you believe you are. If you choose to think of yourself in a particular way, there is nothing I can do to say otherwise. Just remember, you are what you choose to be .” He laughs softly, running a callused thumb across the palm of Malvina 's hand. “It 's almost amusing, I am the youngest person on this island, younger than even the little girl who looks no more than five years old. She is at least eighty years older than me. I 'm a child compared to every one here, and they treat me like it. Mordnacht says I 'm a slave, Sir Lawrence says I am noble man. Your subjects say I am beacon of hope and you say I am your lover. I am the only one who does n't know what I am. Am I a free man ?” Queen Malvina says nothing as the fireplace crackles, the sound of the spitting pinewood filling the empty quiet. Pain flashes across Dieter 's eyes, his gray pupils wetting with tears. “That 's what I thought .” He manages to finally say. “Malvina, all my life I have not been my own person. For years I did as my father ordered. I hid behind the notion that I was not a free man, that every death or act of violence inflicted by my hand was because I was just following orders. When I finally manage to break free of his influence, I was washed onto these shores. Even if you think you understand, I 'm not sure you can truly understand. Do you know how painful it is, loving the same person who holds you captive ?” “I 'm sorry, Dieter ...” Malvina whispers. A gentle smiles crosses his lips, causing him to lean over to kiss her on the lips. “We 're broken birds, Malvina. We were both born into lives of pain; you with your powers and me with my father. And we are both enslaved. Me by you and you by your own self-blame and doubt. The only way for me to be free is for you to be as well. Malvina, I 'm not demanding it from you, and years ago I promised not to asked, but ... will I ever gain my freedom ?” He ends his question in a whisper. Queen Malvina casts her eyes towards the fire, watching the flickering flames dance about the fireplace. “I know you and Sir Lawrence think I can change, but I ca n't.

In one bound the air sprung up from under my feet, so I tried to draw the sword away from my face to make room for more space. Alas! I could neither draw nor strike my adversary; only struck him lightly on the shoulder. He yelled. Just like so many others who have done so, I have met with some success in Heaven.' After seeing the struggle between the man and myself from above there came on him such heavy weeping from the mountain of love to say: ` Your peace is mine, O good knight.' And my own departed brother knocked the point out of his head, saying: ` What are you weeping for? It is to our sweet sister. Aren't we unhappy enough in our position here as you see it?'' he cried to his wife. Yes, but God says that each person who doeth evil must come to a place of peace with himself.' And her husband looked sad and troubled. ` But the boy does as he sees fit,'he said suddenly. ` He will lie down as if to rest, and wait till the son wakes.' At these words the old woman saw what his heart wanted and ran back to her chamber. ` Why, where shall we go?' she said.' I have told you what I want.” Well, have the seven demons come too?''

All the demons except two were flung down except the Man-lion and the Black Crow, who screamed ` Don't do it again! If you strike again we will eat you, and we won't hurt you anymore!' A frightful uproar arose, and the poor women ran into their rooms while the real four robbers threw themselves down under the cabbage bushes near by.

Everybody knows that the cage broke while our comrade lay down in it, and our hands only half-cocked when we began to crawl. I dared say, if the other two had held the door open, how he would never come out alive.' ` By-and-by, dear mother,'answered Liz solemnly; ` but now let us face each other again. As you wished.' This time Liz stood upright and followed Liz into the room.' I will die for you no more,'she said, swinging from her chair ;'I promise,'and making Liz hold hers one hand, and lifting up Liz's head the other, ` on that same day you will become the husband of my heir, whose name is Namaadu.' Liz held out her left hand to avenge her mistresses and sisters if they ever hurt Namaadu. But before she could do any such deed, she heard a voice crying from the other side of the hall: ` Unseen enemy! my well-wishers; save your unhallowed heart! Let our queen who rules over all hearts be set free to her own destiny.' Then Liz seized her right hand and guided her back to Namaadu. Then again Liz forgot her sorrow, for she had never liked her sister enough. But when she heard her brother's name again, she remembered what she had said about Namaadu. ` Your master wishes to marry you,'said she at last. This time she took off the robe on his knee, and found him shaved and dressed to look like a prince. After they shook hands she made him kneel beside his wife, embraced him, and told him how happy she felt when Namaadu married her.","output":"Relevance: 2.7\nCoherence: 3.7\nEmpathy: 3.3\nSurprise: 2.3\nEngagement: 3.3\nComplexity: 3.3"}

That my story and my path could not have been different from the village and people who lived before my time. I remembered all the people in my life. Everything I had ever wanted for anything. My body is the center of my identity. I've lived with many lives. But I don't remember much now. A hooded man in his early forties walks down the street as a man I will never have met. His voice was smooth and deep. Like the soft waves against the sand. The quiet, perfect evening at the park. That night in the park. Those nights. I sat on the grass in front of the beach, watching the green sands frolick up and down the endless summer water. It was getting late and it was a snow day when I walked out of the park and into the woods. I heard the whistle of cars driving by, and I would always be in the park, waiting for them to come back. The world doesn't have a moment, it would only take a moment, and it would be late to leave. This was another life, another person that has lived. Each new person has an identity. They are a force of nature, while each new person is not a force. An outside force to be reckoned with. I thought about where my life would be, a better place. I was thinking of where I would live. I was not alone. But the guy walking down the street, always one step ahead of me. Every time I walked in front of him I would see the smile on his face. Every time I would see him and I would smile. This was not the only person to smile, there were those in the town as well. The man in front of me knew me, and that was why I sat on the grass, watching the green sands frolick up and down the endless summer water. He looked at me and smiled. “What do you want from me?” he said. “I like you, and we should hang out together.”","output":"Relevance: 2.0\nCoherence: 2.7\nEmpathy: 1.7\nSurprise: 1.3\nEngagement: 2.3\nComplexity: 2.0"}

What could have happened? “I found out, and I figure it's on you now.” Jim turned his back on the throngs of people that gathered to watch him.

The only one standing looked shocked. “General Kurtz! Get up. Come with me!

On your quest to stop him, you have found out why, and it turns out he has a pretty damn good reason.\n\nStory:\nIn an quiet throne room made of old stone and dressed in fresh blood, Casper and the Gray Emperor regarded one another with weary resignation. “In the end ,” said the Gray Emperor, groaning as he lowered his weight down to the simple, steel throne, “I could n't save anyone. And perhaps I never should have tried .” “*Saved* ?” The word was bitter and bile in Casper 's mouth. “Have you any idea of the lives you 've taken? The blood you 've spilled ?” “Yes, yes, of course .” The Emperor swept a thin hand down across the dais. “There. Penbrook. My most honorable man-at-arms. He was a smithy when I met him, if you can believe that. A good one, as well. A good *man*. Four children. Beautiful, courageous Eileen back home. He loved darts. Had no taste for gambling. Painted. Worried about my health. Worried about this kingdom. A good man .” The Emperor nodded. “Dead. All of them, dead. My men. *Your* men. Your horse - a beautiful horse, I should add. And brave. I saw the way it leapt across the fiery moat. No other horse would do such a thing .” “Dead defending you ,” said Casper, cold, barely above a whisper. “Dead trying to *kill* you. Dead because of you and the horrors you have unleashed upon this land .” “Certainly ,” said the Emperor. “And I do n't suppose you could be convinced to allow me to continue as I was, eh ?” Casper laughed, nearly weeping with exhaustion and spoiled anxiety. “I never would have guessed you 'd have a sense of humor .” He drew a deep breath and leveled his sword. “But I guess I do n't have much room in my heart for laughter these days .” The Emperor smiled, careful eyes never leaving Casper 's face. “I would n't go so far as to say that the things I 've done have been justified, but it seems it would serve us both to understand what 's at stake .” “Your death ,” said Casper mildly, advancing on the older man. “That is the only thing left on the table. Your reign of terror ends today .” “I 've seen the world - what it becomes ,” said the Emperor hastily, drawing back in his chair. “I 've seen the future. I see it every night when I close my eyes .” “I 'm not concerned with the future ,” said Casper. “Everyone I 've ever loved is dead. My home is half in ruin. What do your nightmares mean to me ?” “The *world* ,” said the Gray Emperor, clutching at the arms of his throne. “You have no idea what it wants to become. No matter what hell you think I 've made here on Earth, you must believe me when I tell how much *worse* it threatens to become .” “Worse than murder ?” said Casper. “Villages burned to the ground? Bloodlines *erased*? Worse than that ?” The Emperor sighed. “I do n't suppose I would ever be able to convince you, but the things I have seen ... they are haunting in ways you could not imagine. What human beings become ... what they do to one another ...” “I have seen the worst of what a human may do .” “Then imagine *demons* !” shouted the Emperor. “Imagine wraiths! Imagine soulless abominations. Feeling nothing. Being nothing. Simply consuming. Ravaging. Anything and everything. Until there is nothing. Because *that* is what I see. *That* is what man strives to make of himself. “I am not a godly man and I do not consider my works holy in any way, but know that the evil I do, I do for the better sake of all mankind. It is a protection. A benediction. I am the evil of the world. I give men like you focus. Hunger. Ambition. I am the lone demon in the dark. And when I am gone, there will be no evil but the evil inside your hearts. The world will be overrun with apathy. No one will be spared .” The Emperor took a slow, steadying breath. Casper watched the old man sweat and shake. “What you describe sounds like freedom ,” said Casper after some time. “It is Hell ,” said the Emperor. “And what if it was just a bad dream ?” The Emperor considered this for some time. “Then I suppose this must be part of the dream, because what torment could be worse than to have done what I 've done ... and been wrong ?” Casper placed the tip of his sword under the Emperor 's neck. “Should I wake you ?”","output":"Relevance: 5.0\nCoherence: 5.0\nEmpathy: 3.0\nSurprise: 4.0\nEngagement: 4.7\nComplexity: 4.3"}
